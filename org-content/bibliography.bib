	abstract = {The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We define metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to "debias" the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10549},
	abstract = {Settings such as lending and policing can be modeled by a centralized agent allocating a resource (loans or police officers) amongst several groups, in order to maximize some objective (loans given that are repaid or criminals that are apprehended). Often in such problems fairness is also a concern. A natural notion of fairness, based on general principles of equality of opportunity, asks that conditional on an individual being a candidate for the resource, the probability of actually receiving it is approximately independent of the individual's group. In lending this means that equally creditworthy individuals in different racial groups have roughly equal chances of receiving a loan. In policing it means that two individuals committing the same crime in different districts would have roughly equal chances of being arrested. We formalize this fairness notion for allocation problems and investigate its algorithmic consequences. Our main technical results include an efficient learning algorithm that converges to an optimal fair allocation even when the frequency of candidates (creditworthy individuals or criminals) in each group is unknown. The algorithm operates in a censored feedback model in which only the number of candidates who received the resource in a given allocation can be observed, rather than the true number of candidates. This models the fact that we do not learn the creditworthiness of individuals we do not give loans to nor learn about crimes committed if the police presence in a district is low. As an application of our framework, we consider the predictive policing problem. The learning algorithm is trained on arrest data gathered from its own deployments on previous days, resulting in a potential feedback loop that our algorithm provably overcomes. We empirically investigate the performance of our algorithm on the Philadelphia Crime Incidents dataset.},

	abstract = {Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.},

	abstract = {Despite vigorous debates about the technical characteristics of risk assessments being deployed in the U.S. criminal justice system, remarkably little research has studied how these tools a�ect actual decision-making processes. After all, risk assessments do not make de�nitive decisions—they inform judges, who are the �nal arbiters. It is therefore essential that considerations of risk assessments be informed by rigorous studies of how judges actually interpret and use them. This paper takes a �rst step toward such research on human interactions with risk assessments through a controlled experimental study on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We found several behaviors that call into question the supposed e�cacy and fairness of risk assessments: our study participants 1) underperformed the risk assessment even when presented with its predictions, 2) could not e�ectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment’s predictions, and 3) exhibited behaviors fraught with “disparate interactions,” whereby the use of risk assessments led to higher risk predictions about black defendants and lower risk predictions about white defendants. These results suggest the need for a new “algorithm-in-the-loop” framework that places machine learning decision-making aids into the sociotechnical context of improving human decisions rather than the technical context of generating the best prediction in the abstract. If risk assessments are to be used at all, they must be grounded in rigorous evaluations of their real-world impacts instead of in their theoretical potential.},

	abstract = {Recent work has shown deep neural networks (DNNs) to be highly susceptible to well-designed, small perturbations at the input layer, or so-called adversarial examples. Taking images as an example, such distortions are often imperceptible, but can result in 100\% mis-classification for a state of the art DNN. We study the structure of adversarial examples and explore network topology, pre-processing and training strategies to improve the robustness of DNNs. We perform various experiments to assess the removability of adversarial examples by corrupting with additional noise and pre-processing with denoising autoencoders (DAEs). We find that DAEs can remove substantial amounts of the adversarial noise. How- ever, when stacking the DAE with the original DNN, the resulting network can again be attacked by new adversarial examples with even smaller distortion. As a solution, we propose Deep Contractive Network, a model with a new end-to-end training procedure that includes a smoothness penalty inspired by the contractive autoencoder (CAE). This increases the network robustness to adversarial examples, without a significant performance penalty.},

	abstract = {Company disclosures greatly aid in the process of financial decision-making; therefore, they are consulted by financial investors and automated traders before exercising ownership in stocks. While humans are usually able to correctly interpret the content, the same is rarely true of computerized decision support systems, which struggle with the complexity and ambiguity of natural language. A possible remedy is represented by deep learning, which overcomes several shortcomings of traditional methods of text mining. For instance, recurrent neural networks, such as long short-term memories, employ hierarchical structures, together with a large number of hidden layers, to automatically extract features from ordered sequences of words and capture highly non-linear relationships such as context-dependent meanings. However, deep learning has only recently started to receive traction, possibly because its performance is largely untested. Hence, this paper studies the use of deep neural networks for financial decision support. We additionally experiment with transfer learning, in which we pre-train the network on a different corpus with a length of 139.1 million words. Our results reveal a higher directional accuracy as compared to traditional machine learning when predicting stock price movements in response to financial disclosures. Our work thereby helps to highlight the business value of deep learning and provides recommendations to practitioners and executives.},

This study explores the pros and cons of video interviewing from the perspectives of 151 hospitality management students from the Southern United States that are currently seeking career placement upon graduation. Participants were asked to go through an online video interview, following which they completed a survey questionnaire. Qualitative findings indicated that some factors that lead to favorableness of video interviewing were comfort, convenience, and saving on resources (money and time), while some factors that resulted in unfavorableness were its impersonal nature, lack of feedback, and technological glitches. Quantitative findings indicated that the overall favorability of video interviewing was low but fairness was high. Based on the findings, recommendations were provided to improve the effectiveness and acceptance of this selection tool.},

	url = {http://aiweirdness.com/post/171451900302/do-neural-nets-dream-of-electric-sheep},
	abstract = {If you’ve been on the internet today, you’ve probably interacted with a neural network. They’re a type of machine learning algorithm that’s used for everything from language translation to finance modeling. One of their specialties is image recognition. Several companies - including Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook - have their own algorithms for labeling photos. But image recognition algorithms can make really bizarre mistakes.

 Microsoft Azure’s computer vision API added the above caption and tags. But there are no sheep in the image of above. None. I zoomed all the way in and inspected every speck. 

 It also tagged sheep in this image. I happen to know there were sheep nearby. But none actually present.

 Here’s one more example. In fact, the neural network hallucinated sheep every time it saw a landscape of this type. What’s going on here?

 The way neural networks learn is by looking at lots of examples. In this case, its trainers gave it lots of images that humans had labeled by hand - and lots of those images contained sheep. Starting with no knowledge at all of what it was seeing, the neural network had to make up rules about which images should be labeled “sheep”. And it looks like it hasn’t realized that “sheep” means the actual animal, not just a sort of treeless grassiness. (Similarly, it labeled the second image with “rainbow” likely because it was wet and rainy, not realizing that the band of colors is essential).

 Are neural networks just hyper-vigilant, finding sheep everywhere? No, as it turns out. They only see sheep where they expect to see them. They can find sheep easily in fields and mountainsides, but as soon as sheep start showing up in weird places, it becomes obvious how much the algorithms rely on guessing and probabilities.

 Bring sheep indoors, and they’re labeled as cats. Pick up a sheep (or a goat) in your arms, and they’re labeled as dogs.

 Paint them orange, and they become flowers. 

 Put the sheep on leashes, and they’re labeled as dogs. Put them in cars, and they’re dogs or cats. If they’re in the water, they could end up being labeled as birds or even polar bears.

 And if goats climb trees, they become birds. Or possibly giraffes. (It turns out that Microsoft Azure is somewhat notorious for seeing giraffes everywhere due to a rumored overabundance of giraffes in the original dataset)

 The thing is, neural networks match patterns. They see patches of furlike texture, a bunch of green, and conclude that there are sheep. If they see fur and kitchen shapes, it may conclude instead that there are cats.

 If life plays by the rules, image recognition works well. But as soon as people - or sheep - do something unexpected, the algorithms show their weaknesses.

 Want to sneak something past a neural network? In a delightfully cyberpunk twist, surrealism might be the answer. Maybe future secret agents will dress in chicken costumes, or drive cow-spotted cars.

 There are lots, lots more examples of hilarious mistakes in a Twitter thread I started with the simple question:

 And you can test Microsoft Azure’s image recognition API and see for yourself that even top-notch algorithms are relying on probability and luck. Another algorithm, NeuralTalk2, is the one I mostly used for the Twitter thread.

We demonstrate the existence of robust 3D adversarial objects, and we present the first algorithm for synthesizing examples that are adversarial over a chosen distribution of transformations. We synthesize two-dimensional adversarial images that are robust to noise, distortion, and affine transformation. We apply our algorithm to complex three-dimensional objects, using 3D-printing to manufacture the first physical adversarial objects.

	abstract = {Recent research has revealed that the output of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) can be easily altered by adding relatively small perturbations to the input vector. In this paper, we analyze an attack in an extremely limited scenario where only one pixel can be modified. For that we propose a novel method for generating one-pixel adversarial perturbations based on differential evolution. It requires less adversarial information and can fool more types of networks. The results show that 70.97\% of the natural images can be perturbed to at least one target class by modifying just one pixel with 97.47\% confidence on average. Thus, the proposed attack explores a different take on adversarial machine learning in an extreme limited scenario, showing that current DNNs are also vulnerable to such low dimension attacks.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks are highly expressive models that have recently achieved state of the art performance on speech and visual recognition tasks. While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties. First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks. Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.},

	abstract = {Several machine learning models, including neural networks, consistently misclassify adversarial examples---inputs formed by applying small but intentionally worst-case perturbations to examples from the dataset, such that the perturbed input results in the model outputting an incorrect answer with high confidence. Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.},

	abstract = {Obtaining deep networks that are robust against adversarial examples and generalize well is an open problem. A recent hypothesis even states that both robust and accurate models are impossible, i.e., adversarial robustness and generalization are conflicting goals. In an effort to clarify the relationship between robustness and generalization, we assume an underlying, low-dimensional data manifold and show that: 1. regular adversarial examples leave the manifold; 2. adversarial examples constrained to the manifold, i.e., on-manifold adversarial examples, exist; 3. on-manifold adversarial examples are generalization errors, and on-manifold adversarial training boosts generalization; 4. and regular robustness is independent of generalization. These assumptions imply that both robust and accurate models are possible. However, different models (architectures, training strategies etc.) can exhibit different robustness and generalization characteristics. To confirm our claims, we present extensive experiments on synthetic data (with access to the true manifold) as well as on EMNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CelebA.},

This article discusses different aspects of knowledge work that tend to be ignored in the debate about whether or not artificial intelligence systems are a threat to jobs. A great deal of knowledge work concerns highly complex problem solving and must be understood in contextual, social and relational terms. These aspects have no generic nor universal rules and solutions and, thus, cannot be easily replaced by artificial intelligence or programmed into computer systems, nor are they constructed based on models of the rational brain.

However, in order to achieve good performance, the predictive features of the system need to be manually engineered by human experts. We introduce a model that forms word representations by learning the extent to which specific words contribute to the text's score. Using Long-Short Term Memory networks to represent the meaning of texts, we demonstrate that a fully automated framework is able to achieve excellent results over similar approaches. In an attempt to make our results more interpretable, and inspired by recent advances in visualizing neural networks, we introduce a novel method for identifying the regions of the text that the model has found more discriminative.},

To this aim, we point out how uncertainty is so ingrained in medicine that it biases also the representation of clinical phenomena, that is the very input of ML models, thus undermining the clinical significance of their output. Recognizing this can motivate both medical doctors, in taking more responsibility in the development and use of these decision aids, and the researchers, in pursuing different ways to assess the value of these systems. In so doing, both designers and users could take this intrinsic characteristic of medicine more seriously and consider alternative approaches that do not "sweep uncertainty under the rug" within an objectivist fiction, which everyone can come up by believing as true.},

It is also experienced on the ground as means to develop and maintain particular norms of health business, knowledge, and decision- and profit-making that are not innocent. Statistics make possible audit and accountability logics that undergird the management of health at a distance and that are increasingly necessary to the business of health. Health statistics are inextricable from their social milieus, yet as business artifacts they operate as if they are freely formed, objectively originated, and accurate. This article explicates health statistics as cultural forms and shows how they have been produced and performed in two very different countries: Sierra Leone and Germany. In both familiar and surprising ways, this article shows how statistics and their pursuit organize and discipline human behavior, constitute subject positions, and reify existing relations of power.},

	abstract = {Achieving nationwide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) remains an important policy priority. While EHR adoption has increased steadily since 2010, it is unclear how providers that have not yet adopted will fare now that federal incentives have converted to penalties. We used 2008–14 national data, which includes the most recently available, to examine hospital EHR trends. We found large gains in adoption, with 75 percent of US hospitals now having adopted at least a basic EHR system—up from 59 percent in 2013. However, small and rural hospitals continue to lag behind. Among hospitals without a basic EHR system, the function most often not yet adopted (in 61 percent of hospitals) was physician notes. We also saw large increases in the ability to meet core stage 2 meaningful-use criteria (40.5 percent of hospitals, up from 5.8 percent in 2013); much of this progress resulted from increased ability to meet criteria related to exchange of health information with patients and with other physicians during care transitions. Finally, hospitals most often reported up-front and ongoing costs, physician cooperation, and complexity of meeting meaningful-use criteria as challenges. Our findings suggest that nationwide hospital EHR adoption is in reach but will require attention to small and rural hospitals and strategies to address financial challenges, particularly now that penalties for lack of adoption have begun.},

EHRs are structured to prioritize the interests of a myriad of political and corporate stakeholders, resulting in a complex, multi-layered, and cumbersome health records system, largely not directly relevant to clinical care. Drawing on observations conducted in outpatient specialty clinics, we consider how EHRs prioritize institutional needs manifested as a long list of requisites that must be documented with each consultation. We argue that the EHR enforces the centrality of market principles in clinical medicine, redefining the clinician's role to be less of a medical expert and more of an administrative bureaucrat, and transforming the patient into a digital entity with standardized conditions, treatments, and goals, without a personal narrative.},

Using the clinical data warehouse at Columbia University Medical Center in the City of New York, we mined EHR data elements collected between 1999 and 2009 for a cohort of pancreatic cancer patients. Of the 3068 patients who had ICD-9-CM diagnoses for pancreatic cancer, only 1589 had corresponding disease documentation in pathology reports. Incompleteness was the leading data quality issue; many study variables had missing values to various degrees. Inaccuracy and inconsistency were the next common problems. In this paper, we present the manifestations of these data quality issues and discuss some strategies for using emerging informatics technologies to solve these problems.},

While scholarship on professional power has tended toward the opposite poles of professional dominance and deprofessionalization or proletarianization, I find that doctors' interactions with the EMR reconcile these perspectives by making physicians' professional identities consistent with their subordination to bureaucratic authority. After examining the electronic medical record as a disciplinary technology, the paper analyzes variation in the extent to which practitioners' professional identities are reconciled with bureaucratic subordination across the different departments studies.},

	abstract = {Big Data evangelists often argue that algorithms make decision-making more informed and objective—a promise hotly contested by critics of these technologies. Yet, to date, most of the debate has focused on the instruments themselves, rather than on how they are used. This article addresses this lack by examining the actual practices surrounding algorithmic technologies. Specifically, drawing on multi-sited ethnographic data, I compare how algorithms are used and interpreted in two institutional contexts with markedly different characteristics: web journalism and criminal justice. I find that there are surprising similarities in how web journalists and legal professionals use algorithms in their work. In both cases, I document a gap between the intended and actual effects of algorithms—a process I analyze as “decoupling.” Second, I identify a gamut of buffering strategies used by both web journalists and legal professionals to minimize the impact of algorithms in their daily work. Those include foot-dragging, gaming, and open critique. Of course, these similarities do not exhaust the differences between the two cases, which are explored in the discussion section. I conclude with a call for further ethnographic work on algorithms in practice as an important empirical check against the dominant rhetoric of algorithmic power.},

	abstract = {It is a special characteristic of all modern societies that we consciously decide on and plan projects designed to improve our social systems. It is our universal predicament that our projects do not always have their intended effects. Very probably we all share in the experience that often we cannot tell whether the project had any impact at all, so complex is the flux of historical changes that would have been going on anyway, and so many are the other projects that might be expected to modify the same indicators. It seems inevitable that in most countries this common set of problems, combined with the obvious relevance of social science research procedures, will have generated a methodology and methodological specialists focused on the problem of assessing the impact of planned social change. It is an assumption if this paper that, in spite of differences in the forms of government and approaches to social planning and problem-solving, much of this methodology can be usefully shared — that social project evaluation methodology is one of the fields of science that has enough universality to make scientific sharing mutually beneficial. As a part of this sharing, this paper reports on program impact assessment methodology as it is developing in the United States today.},

	abstract = {Early results in using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on x-rays to diagnose disease have been promising, but it has not yet been shown that models trained on x-rays from one hospital or one group of hospitals will work equally well at different hospitals. Before these tools are used for computer-aided diagnosis in real-world clinical settings, we must verify their ability to generalize across a variety of hospital systems. A cross-sectional design was used to train and evaluate pneumonia screening CNNs on 158,323 chest x-rays from NIH (n=112,120 from 30,805 patients), Mount Sinai (42,396 from 12,904 patients), and Indiana (n=3,807 from 3,683 patients). In 3 / 5 natural comparisons, performance on chest x-rays from outside hospitals was significantly lower than on held-out x-rays from the original hospital systems. CNNs were able to detect where an x-ray was acquired (hospital system, hospital department) with extremely high accuracy and calibrate predictions accordingly. The performance of CNNs in diagnosing diseases on x-rays may reflect not only their ability to identify disease-specific imaging findings on x-rays, but also their ability to exploit confounding information. Estimates of CNN performance based on test data from hospital systems used for model training may overstate their likely real-world performance.},

On the basis of a participant observation study of routine police patrol in inner city London, the article explores the influence of race in relation to citizen and officer demeanour, and on the actions taken by police in initiating, processing and terminating a stop. Demeanour and process variables are derived from quantified observational data recorded on codified observation schedules from 213 police stops involving 319 members of the public. Among the findings reported, blacks prove over two and a half times more likely to be stopped than their presence in the local population would suggest, with a higher disproportion in the case of young black men. However, blacks and whites prove equally likely to be calm and civil to police at contact and during processing, and there are scant differences in police demeanour and action toward the two groups.},

	abstract = {The Internet has created a permanent and pervasive treasure trove of digital fingerprints beyond any scale created by prior information technologies such as television, radio, or the telephone.  Internet users increasingly live their private lives in public through the self-immolation of their own privacy. Blogging, photo sharing, texting, instant messaging, and other postings on social media sites obliterate the division between the public and the private spheres. Facebook is where a less educated person can share with friends but this also means sharing how inept they are in managing privacy settings. Wearing gang styles such as a baseball cap worn backwards, colored bandanas, and baggy pants are considered to be cool styles by minority youth but create misleading stereotypes when viewed by mainstream Americans. A minority youth wearing a six-point star, a crescent moon, or a Playboy Bunny symbol to be cool is, in effect, sporting a self-inflicted digital scarlet letter, as these are also styles associated with gang membership. These stigmatizing images are posted on a 24/7 worldwide bulletin board, creating a virtual Scarlet Letter that negatively impacts educational, employment, and other opportunities. We provide a sociological overview of how social media amplifies stereotypic images of the poor that undermine their economic and educational opportunities. We explore the ways that increased Internet and social media usage is a catalyst for advancing equality but also can devalue the uneducated and the poor. The Internet has lifted the veil of individual privacy, so that information about factors like race, class, gender, sexual orientation, obesity, physical handicaps, unpopular opinions, and nonmainstream clothing styles become easily visible to employers, potential employers, college admissions personnel, law enforcement officials, welfare providers, loan companies, landlords, merchants, and many other societal decision makers. Youthful hijinks should not stigmatize an individual forever. We argue for a limited right to be forgotten  especially "relevant, when the data subject has given their consent as a child, when not being fully aware of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to remove such personal data especially on the Internet." The EU's "right to erasure" provision would be particularly useful to America's poor and less educated who seek to remove evidence of their spoiled identity.},

	url = {http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2241306},
	abstract = {During the last fifteen years, Congress has deregulated, wholly or partly, a number of infrastructure industries, including most modes of transport - airlines, motor carriers, railroads, and intercity bus companies. Deregulation emerged in a comprehensive ideological movement which abhorred governmental pricing and entry controls as manifestly causing waste and inefficiency, while denying consumers the range of price and service options they desire. In a nation dedicated to free market capitalism, governmental restraints on the freedom to enter into a business or allowing the competitive market to set the price seem fundamentally at odds with immutable notions of economic liberty. While in the late 19th and early 20th Century, market failure gave birth to economic regulation of infrastructure industries, today, we live in an era where the conventional wisdom is that government can do little good and the market can do little wrong.Despite this passionate and powerful contemporary political/economic ideological movement, one mode of transportation has come full circle from regulation, through deregulation, and back again to regulation - the taxi industry. American cities began regulating local taxi firms in the 1920s. Beginning a half century later, more than 20 cities, most located in the Sunbelt, totally or partially deregulated their taxi companies. However, the experience with taxicab deregulation was so profoundly unsatisfactory that virtually every city that embraced it has since jettisoned it in favor of resumed economic regulation. Today, nearly all large and medium-sized communities regulate their local taxicab companies. Typically, regulation of taxicabs involves: (1) limited entry (restricting the number of firms, and/or the ratio of taxis to population), usually under a standard of "public convenience and necessity," [PC\&N] (2) just, reasonable, and non-discriminatory fares, (3) service standards (e.g., vehicular and driver safety standards, as well as a common carrier obligation of non-discriminatory service, 24-hour radio dispatch capability, and a minimum level of response time), and (4) financial responsibility standards (e.g., insurance). This article explores the legal, historical, economic, and philosophical bases of regulation and deregulation in the taxi industry, as well as the empirical results of taxi deregulation. The paradoxical metamorphosis from regulation, to deregulation, and back again, to regulation is an interesting case study of the collision of economic theory and ideology, with empirical reality. We begin with a look at the historical origins of taxi regulation.},

	shorttitle = {People's platform},
	abstract = {From a cutting-edge cultural commentator and documentary filmmaker, this work is a bold and brilliant challenge to cherished notions of the Internet as the great democratizing force of our age. The Internet has been hailed as a place where all can be heard and everyone can participate equally. But how true is this claim? In this seminal dismantling of techno-utopian visions, the author argues that for all that we "tweet" and "like" and "share," the Internet in fact reflects and amplifies real-world inequities at least as much as it ameliorates them. Online, just as off-line, attention and influence largely accrue to those who already have plenty of both. What we have seen so far, she says, has been not a revolution but a rearrangement. Silicon Valley tycoons now coexist with Hollywood moguls; a handful of giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Facebook remain the gatekeepers. And the worst habits of the old media model, the pressure to seek easy celebrity, to be quick and sensational above all, have proliferated online, where "aggregating" the work of others is the surest way to attract eyeballs and ad revenue. When culture is "free," creative work has diminishing value and advertising fuels the system. The new order looks suspiciously like the old one. We can do better, the author insists. The online world does offer an unprecedented opportunity, but a democratic culture that supports diverse voices, work of lasting value, and equitable business practices will not appear as a consequence of technology alone. If we want the Internet to truly be a people's platform, we will have to make it so.-- Publisher information.},

I show that there are several problems of justice that emerge as a consequence of opening data to full public accessibility, and are generally a consequence of the failure of the open data movement to understand the constructed nature of data. I examine three such problems: the embedding of social privilege in datasets as the data is constructed, the differential capabilities of data users (especially differences between citizens and “enterprise” users), and the norms that data systems impose through their function as disciplinary systems. In each case I show that open data has the quite real potential to exacerbate rather than alleviate injustices. This necessitates a theory of information justice. I briefly suggest two complementary directions in which such a theory might be developed: one defining a set of moral inquiries that can be used to evaluate the justness of data practices, and another exploring the practices and structures that a social movement promoting information justice might pursue.},

The second shows how screening enables some institutions act as havens for dissent, even under strong and stable authoritarian regimes. The third model links rational choice models to the “WUNC displays” of social movement theory and describes the “Dictator’s Dilemma” that uprisings may pose for authoritarian governments.Taken together, these models suggest that an identity-driven rational choice framework can describe a wide range of phenomena related to contentious politics in authoritarian states.},

	abstract = {Critics charge that the new sharing-economy services are so lucrative - and so laxly regulated - that they are forcing out residents and driving up rents by reducing the supply of available housing.  Short-term stays violate San Francisco laws against rentals of less than 30 days, and Airbnb and its hosts fail to collect the city's 14 percent hotel occupancy tax.  Robert Sheppard, an attorney for the landlords, said in an e-mail: "There was nothing improper or illegal done by the owners in 2012 or since."  While the private company doesn't release its financials, a conservative estimate puts its revenue at \$100 million a year.  The company commissioned a study from UC Berkeley business Professor Ken Rosen a few months ago that found that short-term rentals of perhaps a couple of thousand at a time are such a small percentage of the city's 378,000 apartments, homes and condominiums that they "cannot have a measurable impact on housing costs or renter demand."  Mayor's stance on rentalsFrancis Tsang, a spokesman for Mayor Ed Lee, said in a statement that the mayor just outlined his commitment to protect rental housing in his State of the City speech on Friday through such measures as reform of the Ellis Act, the state law that allows evictions for certain causes.  Calls about AirbnbTenant-rights attorney Tobener said lately he gets about 15 calls a week related to Airbnb on a range of issues: people like Butler who say they were evicted in favor of Airbnb rentals, tenants being evicted for renting out their apartments on the service, and tenants trying to stop their neighbors from hosting short-term guests.  Sheppard, the owners' attorney, said Butler has refused offers to return to his former apartment and that renting the apartments on Airbnb is temporary until Butler decides if he wants to move back in.},

	abstract = {Big Data, large-scale aggregate databases of imprints of online and social media activity, has captured scientific and policy attention. However, this emergent field is challenged by inadequate attention to methodological and conceptual issues. I review key methodological and conceptual challenges including: 1) Inadequate attention to the implicit and explicit structural biases of the platform(s) most frequently used to generate datasets (the model organism problem). 2) The common practice of selecting on the dependent variable without corresponding attention to the complications of this path. 3) Lack of clarity with regard to sampling, universe and representativeness (the denominator problem). 4) Most big data analyses come from a single platform (hence missing the ecology of information flows). Conceptual issues reviewed in this paper include: 1) More research is needed to interpret aggregated mediated interactions. Clicks, status updates, links, retweets, etc. are complex social interactions.  2) Network methods imported from other fields need to be carefully reconsidered to evaluate appropriateness for analyzing human social media imprints. 3) Most big datasets contain information only on “node-to-node” interaction. However, “field” effects – events that affect a society or a group in a wholesale fashion either through shared experience or through broadcast media – are an important part of human socio-cultural experience. 4.Human reflexivity – that humans will alter behaviors around metrics – needs to be assumed and built into the analysis.  5) Assuming additivity and counting interactions so that each new interaction is seen as (n 1) without regards to the semantics or context can be misleading. 6) The relationship between network structure and other attributes is complex and multi-faceted.},

	abstract = {With the radical changes in information production that the Internet has introduced, we stand at an important moment of transition, says Yochai Benkler in this thought-provoking book. The phenomenon he describes as social production is reshaping markets, while at the same time offering new opportunities to enhance individual freedom, cultural diversity, political discourse, and justice. But these results are by no means inevitable: a systematic campaign to protect the entrenched industrial information economy of the last century threatens the promise of today’s emerging networked information environment. In this comprehensive social theory of the Internet and the networked information economy, Benkler describes how patterns of information, knowledge, and cultural production are changing—and shows that the way information and knowledge are made available can either limit or enlarge the ways people can create and express themselves. He describes the range of legal and policy choices that confront us and maintains that there is much to be gained—or lost—by the decisions we make today.},

	abstract = {Like many major revolutions in history, the East European Revolution of 1989 caught its leaders, participants, victims, and observers by surprise. This paper offers and explanation whose crucial feature is a distinction between private and public preferences. By suppressing their antipathies to the political status quo, the East Europeans misled everyone, including themselves, as to the possibility of a successful uprising. In effect, they conferred on their privately despised governments an aura of invincibility. Under the circumstances, public opposition was poised to grow explosively if ever enough people lost their fear of exposing their private preferences. The currently popular theories of revolution do not make clear why uprisings easily explained in retrospect may not have been anticipated. The theory developed here fills this void. Among its predictions is that political revolutions will inevitably continue to catch the world by surprise.},

These scientists have demonstrated that they can often “reidentify” or “deanonymize” individuals hidden in anonymized data with astonishing ease.  By understanding this research, we realize we have made a mistake, labored beneath a fundamental misunderstanding, which has assured us much less privacy than we have assumed.  This mistake pervades nearly every information privacy law, regulation, and debate, yet regulators and legal scholars have paid it scant attention.

	abstract = {Upon what kind of moral order does capitalism rest? Conversely, does the market give rise to a distinctive set of beliefs, habits, and social bonds? These questions are certainly as old as social science itself. In this review, we evaluate how today's scholarship approaches the relationship between markets and the moral order. We begin with Hirschman's characterization of the three rival views of the market as civilizing, destructive, or feeble in its effects on society. We review recent work at the intersection of sociology, economics, and political economy and show that these views persist both as theories of market society and moral arguments about it. We then argue that a fourth view, which we call moralized markets, has become increasingly prominent in economic sociology. This line of research sees markets as cultural phenomena and moral projects in their own right, and seeks to study the mechanisms and techniques by which such projects are realized in practice.},

	abstract = {Existing literature on open source software (OSS) maintains that intrinsic motivation and extrinsic financial rewards have a unidimensionally positive effect on the motivation of individual developers. Based on self-determination theory, which underlies most of these studies, we challenge this assumption. We argue that the effect of payment on both intrinsic motivation and total motivation of OSS developers is far more complex. To illustrate our point, we introduce the concept of individuals’ norms about payment to the field of OSS. In doing so, we are able to show that payment norms moderate the effect of payment on intrinsic motivation and total motivation. Conducting a scenario experiment, we find that intrinsic motivation decreases for individuals with norms against payment. This effect becomes even stronger when analyzing for mediation effects. Total motivation is impacted positively by payment, but the effect turns insignificant for individuals with norms for payment. Our findings help explain the results of previous studies in which OSS developers did not seem to be affected by motivation crowding. They further contribute to the more general debate on how to manage individuals in the absence of formal contracts. From a practical perspective, we show that financial rewards may create a management dilemma for OSS project leaders.},

	abstract = {Judging by the millions of reviews left by guests on the Airbnb platform, this "trusted community marketplace" is fulfilling its mission of matching travelers seeking accommodation with hosts who have room to spare remarkably well.  Based on our analysis of ratings we collected for over 600,000 properties listed on Airbnb worldwide, we find that nearly 95\% of Airbnb properties boast an average user-generated rating of either 4.5 or 5 stars (the maximum); virtually none have less than a 3.5 star rating. We contrast this with the ratings of approximately half a million hotels worldwide that we collected on TripAdvisor, where there is a much lower average rating of 3.8 stars, and more variance across reviews. Considering properties by accommodation type and by location, we find considerable variability in ratings, and observe that vacation rental properties on TripAdvisor have ratings most similar to ratings of Airbnb properties. Last, we consider several thousand properties that are listed on both platforms. For these cross-listed properties, we find that even though the average ratings on Airbnb and TripAdvisor are similar, proportionally more properties receive the highest ratings (4.5 stars and above) on Airbnb than on TripAdvisor. Moreover, there is only weak correlation in the ratings of individual cross-listed properties across the two platforms. Our work is a first step towards understanding and interpreting nuances of user-generated ratings in the context of the sharing economy.},

Starting with San Francisco in 2012, Airbnb has now produced a series of economic impact reports that not only evaluate the impact of diversifying tourism options, but also put numbers to the thousands of stories we hear about how Airbnb is changing the way people live and travel. Each of the studies presented here reviews the findings of host and guest surveys, Airbnb bookings data, and analysis by local economists in the cities we study. In addition to traditional outputs, such as total economic impact and number of jobs created, the studies also present a broader range of impacts – summarizing where Airbnb guests are spending their money, how they differ from traditional tourists, and how the income earned by resident hosts and local businesses…Continue Reading},

	volume = {126},
	url = {https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/e.710.Khan.805_zuvfyyeh.pdf},
	abstract = {Amazon is the titan of twenty-first century commerce. In addition to being a retailer,
it is now a marketing platform, a delivery and logistics network, a payment service, a credit
lender, an auction house, a major book publisher, a producer of television and films, a fashion
designer, a hardware manufacturer, and a leading host of cloud server space. Although Amazon
has clocked staggering growth, it generates meager profits, choosing to price below-cost and expand
widely instead. Through this strategy, the company has positioned itself at the center of ecommerce
and now serves as essential infrastructure for a host of other businesses that depend
upon it. Elements of the firm’s structure and conduct pose anticompetitive concerns—yet it has
escaped antitrust scrutiny.
 This Note argues that the current framework in antitrust—specifically its pegging competition
to “consumer welfare,” defined as short-term price effects—is unequipped to capture the architecture
of market power in the modern economy. We cannot cognize the potential harms to
competition posed by Amazon’s dominance if we measure competition primarily through price
and output. Specifically, current doctrine underappreciates the risk of predatory pricing and how
integration across distinct business lines may prove anticompetitive. These concerns are heightened
in the context of online platforms for two reasons. First, the economics of platform markets
create incentives for a company to pursue growth over profits, a strategy that investors have rewarded.
Under these conditions, predatory pricing becomes highly rational—even as existing
doctrine treats it as irrational and therefore implausible. Second, because online platforms serve
as critical intermediaries, integrating across business lines positions these platforms to control
the essential infrastructure on which their rivals depend. This dual role also enables a platform to
exploit information collected on companies using its services to undermine them as competitors.
 This Note maps out facets of Amazon’s dominance. Doing so enables us to make sense of its
business strategy, illuminates anticompetitive aspects of Amazon’s structure and conduct, and
underscores deficiencies in current doctrine. The Note closes by considering two potential regimes
for addressing Amazon’s power: restoring traditional antitrust and competition policy
principles or applying common carrier obligations and duties.},

	abstract = {This contribution reviews recent critiques of the food sovereignty framework. In particular it engages with the debate between Henry Bernstein and Philip McMichael and analyses their different conceptualizations of agrarian capitalism. It critically identifies tendencies in food sovereignty approaches to assume a food regime crisis, to one‐sidedly emphasize accumulation by dispossession and enclosure and thereby to overlook the importance of expanded reproduction, and to espouse a romantic optimism about farmerdriven agroecological knowledge which is devoid of modern science. Alternatives to current modernization trajectories cannot simply return to the peasant past and to the local. Instead, they need to recognize the desires of farmers to be incorporated into larger commodity networks, the importance of industrialization and complex chains for feeding the world population, and the support of state and science, as well as social movements, for realizing a food sovereign alternative.},

Peer transportation companies such as Uber and Lyft present the opportunity to rectify long-standing discrimination or worsen it. We sent passengers in Seattle, WA and Boston, MA to hail nearly 1,500 rides on controlled routes and recorded key performance metrics. Results indicated a pattern of discrimination, which we observed in Seattle through longer waiting times for African American passengers—as much as a 35 percent increase. In Boston, we observed discrimination by Uber drivers via more frequent cancellations against passengers when they used African American-sounding names. Across all trips, the cancellation rate for African American sounding names was more than twice as frequent compared to white sounding names. Male passengers requesting a ride in low-density areas were more than three times as likely to have their trip canceled when they used a African American-sounding name than when they used a white-sounding name. We also find evidence that drivers took female passengers for longer, more expensive, rides in Boston. We observe that removing names from trip booking may alleviate the immediate problem but could introduce other pathways for unequal treatment of passengers.},

While Google Scholar shows only nine results for the phrase “sociology of quantification” through 2007, the last decade returns 448. This proliferation of scholarship on numbers goes hand in hand with a proliferation of numbers themselves. New technologies have created a “quantified self,” and the explosion of the internet has produced “big data”. As a senior sociologist recently quipped to one of us, sociology has become quantitative researchers, and qualitative researchers studying quantification. Thus the moment seems ripe for revisiting the sociology of quantification, looking at emerging themes, and seeking signs that a new subfield might be starting to consolidate.Alas, the news is mixed. Lots of good work is being done. The intellectual space is full of ferment. Yet—and perhaps the fact that we were reviewing books by authors from at least four different disciplines should have clued us in earlier—so far, we seem to be looking at a genre, not a subfield....},

	abstract = {Uber has attracted the attention of economists and policy makers for its innovations in the taxicab market and its potential for signiﬁcant consumer welfare gains. The size of this gain depends in part on whether these innovations permit transactions previously costly or infeasible. Using New York City — the largest taxi market in the country — as its context, this paper estimates the level of any technological advantage Uber has over hail taxis in matching to consumers. I combine publicly available transportation data with data scraped from Uber and traﬃc cameras to estimate a model of the demand for transportation services and imbed it in a spatial equilibrium framework in which Uber and taxis compete for customers. I ﬁnd that Uber’s matching advantage depends on the density of the market and translates into highly heterogeneous beneﬁts to customers across the city. In consumer welfare terms, I estimate that the introduction of Uber added only \$0.10 per ride in the densest parts of New York but over \$1.00 in the least dense. These results, combined with the high volume of substitution from taxis to Uber in central Manhattan, imply Uber’s appeal in its densest market has depended signiﬁcantly on advantages independent from its matching technology, including its lower regulatory burden.},

We explore this by examining labor supply choices and earnings among more than a million rideshare drivers on Uber in the U.S. We document a roughly 7\% gender earnings gap amongst drivers. We completely explain this gap and show that it can be entirely attributed to three factors: experience on the platform (learning-by-doing), preferences over where to work (driven largely by where drivers live and, to a lesser extent, safety), and preferences for driving speed. We do not ﬁnd that men and women are diﬀerentially aﬀected by a taste for speciﬁc hours, a return to within-week work intensity, or customer discrimination. Our results suggest that there is no reason to expect the “gig” economy to close gender diﬀerences. Even in the absence of discrimination and in ﬂexible labor markets, women’s relatively high opportunity cost of non-paid-work time and gender-based diﬀerences in preferences and constraints can sustain a gender pay gap.},

We present our perspective not with the intention of pushing the frontier of new modeling techniques. Instead, ours is a story of the elements we found useful in applying neural networks to a real life product. Deep learning was steep learning for us.

	abstract = {The late 2016 case of the Facebook content moderation controversy over the infamous Vietnam-era photo, “The Terror of War,” is examined in this paper for both its specifics, as well as a mechanism to engage in a larger discussion of the politics and economics of the content moderation of user-generated content. In the context of mainstream commercial social media platforms, obfuscation and secrecy work together to form an operating logic of opacity, a term and concept introduced in this paper. The lack of clarity around platform policies, procedures and the values that inform them lead users to wildly different interpretations of the user experience on the same site, resulting in confusion in no small part by the platforms’ own design. Platforms operationalize their content moderation practices under a complex web of nebulous rules and procedural opacity, while governments and other actors clamor for tighter controls on some material, and other members of civil society demand greater freedoms for online expression. Few parties acknowledge the fact that mainstream social media platforms are already highly regulated, albeit rarely in such a way that can be satisfactory to all. The final turn in the paper connects the functions of the commercial content moderation process on social media platforms like Facebook to their output, being either the content that appears on a site, or content that is rescinded: digital detritus. While meaning and intent of user-generated content may often be imagined to be the most important factors by which content is evaluated for a site, this paper argues that its value to the platform as a potentially revenue-generating commodity is actually the key criterion and the one to which all moderation decisions are ultimately reduced. The result is commercialized online spaces that have far less to offer in terms of political and democratic challenge to the status quo and which, in fact, may serve to reify and consolidate power rather than confront it.},

Drawing on a recent qualitative study of caseworker decision-making in the Ontario Works program, it demonstrates the dialectical relationship between new case management software and caseworkers. While new technologies may attempt to deskill and decentre front-line decision-makers, transforming them into data entry clerks, caseworkers learn how to expertly translate and input client data to produce decisions that more closely match their interpretation of clients’ needs and welfare laws. The ways in which workers “manipulate the system” to produce a particular decision, though common knowledge among their colleagues, are black boxed to program managers, auditors, and benefits recipients.

Cet article examine les façons par lesquelles les nouvelles technologies de réglementation et les décideurs de première ligne se remodèlent mutuellement. En se fondant sur une récente étude qualitative du processus de prise de décision de travailleurs sociaux du programme Ontario au travail, l’on expose la relation dialectique entre le nouveau logiciel de gestion de cas et les travailleurs sociaux. Alors que les nouvelles technologies visent à réduire le rôle et l’importance des décideurs de première ligne, transformant ceux-ci en simples commis de saisie de données, les travailleurs sociaux apprennent à traduire et à entrer les données des clients de façon à produire les décisions qui correspondent à leur perception des besoins des clients et des lois sur l’assistance sociale. La capacité des travailleurs sociaux à « manipuler le système » pour obtenir une décision donnée est bien connue d’eux-mêmes mais soigneusement cachée des gestionnaires de programmes, des vérificateurs et des bénéficiaires de prestations.},

Theoretically, Uber’s effect on transit is ambiguous: while Uber is an alternative mode of travel, it can also increase the reach and flexibility of public transit’s fixed-route, fixed-schedule service. We estimate the effect of Uber on public transit ridership using a difference-in-differences design that exploits variation across U.S. metropolitan areas in both the intensity of Uber penetration and the timing of Uber entry. We find that Uber is a complement for the average transit agency, increasing ridership by five percent after two years. This average effect masks considerable heterogeneity, with Uber increasing ridership more in larger cities and for smaller transit agencies.},

Therefore, business transactions and analytics must co-exist together in a single platform to empower business users to drive insights, make decisions, and complete business processes in a single application and using a single source of facts without toggling between multiple applications. Traditionally transactional systems and analytics were maintained separately to improve throughput of the transactional system and that certainly introduced latency in decision making. However, with innovation in the SAP HANA platform, SAP S/4HANA embedded analytics enables business users, business analysts, and management to perform real-time analytics on live transactional data.

	abstract = {One way to unwind mass incarceration without compromising public safety is to use risk assessment instruments in sentencing and corrections. Although these instruments figure prominently in current reforms, critics argue that benefits in crime control will be offset by an adverse effect on racial minorities.  Based on a sample of 34,794 federal offenders, we examine the relationships among race, risk assessment (the Post Conviction Risk Assessment [PCRA]), and future arrest.  First, application of well-established principles of psychological science revealed little evidence of test bias for the PCRA — the instrument strongly predicts arrest for both Black and White offenders and a given score has essentially the same meaning — i.e., same probability of recidivism — across groups. Second, Black offenders obtain higher average PCRA scores than White offenders (d= 0.34; 13.5\% non-overlap in groups’ scores), so some applications could create disparate impact.  Third, most (66\%) of the racial difference in PCRA scores is attributable to criminal history — which is already embedded in sentencing guidelines.  Finally, criminal history is not a proxy for race, but instead mediates the relationship between race and future arrest .  Data are more helpful than rhetoric, if the goal is to improve practice at this opportune moment in history.},

Our article comments upon the potential benefits of such tools, explains the concept and method of HART and considers the results of the first validation of the model’s use and accuracy. The article then critiques the use of algorithmic tools within policing from a societal and legal perspective, focusing in particular upon substantive common law grounds for judicial review. It considers a concept of ‘experimental’ proportionality to permit the use of unproven algorithms in the public sector in a controlled and time-limited way, and as part of a combination of approaches to combat algorithmic opacity, proposes ‘ALGO-CARE’, a guidance framework of some of the key legal and practical concerns that should be considered in relation to the use of algorithmic risk assessment tools by the police. The article concludes that for the use of algorithmic tools in a policing context to result in a ‘better’ outcome, that is to say, a more efficient use of police resources in a landscape of more consistent, evidence-based decision-making, then an ‘experimental’ proportionality approach should be developed to ensure that new solutions from ‘big data’ can be found for criminal justice problems traditionally arising from clouded, non-augmented decision-making. Finally, this article notes that there is a sub-set of decisions around which there is too great an impact upon society and upon the welfare of individuals for them to be influenced by an emerging technology; to an extent, in fact, that they should be removed from the influence of algorithmic decision-making altogether.},

	abstract = {Actuarial risk assessments might be unduly perceived as a neutral way to counteract implicit bias and increase the fairness of decisions made at almost every juncture of the criminal justice system, from pretrial release to sentencing, parole and probation. In recent times these assessments have come under increased scrutiny, as critics claim that the statistical techniques underlying them might reproduce existing patterns of discrimination and historical biases that are reflected in the data. Much of this debate is centered around competing notions of fairness and predictive accuracy, resting on the contested use of variables that act as "proxies" for characteristics legally protected against discrimination, such as race and gender. We argue that a core ethical debate surrounding the use of regression in risk assessments is not simply one of bias or accuracy. Rather, it's one of purpose. If machine learning is operationalized merely in the service of predicting individual future crime, then it becomes difficult to break cycles of criminalization that are driven by the iatrogenic effects of the criminal justice system itself. We posit that machine learning should not be used for prediction, but rather to surface covariates that are fed into a causal model for understanding the social, structural and psychological drivers of crime. We propose an alternative application of machine learning and causal inference away from predicting risk scores to risk mitigation.},

	abstract = {What does it mean for an algorithm to be biased? In U.S. law, unintentional bias is encoded via disparate impact, which occurs when a selection process has widely different outcomes for different groups, even as it appears to be neutral. This legal determination hinges on a definition of a protected class (ethnicity, gender, religious practice) and an explicit description of the process. When the process is implemented using computers, determining disparate impact (and hence bias) is harder. It might not be possible to disclose the process. In addition, even if the process is open, it might be hard to elucidate in a legal setting how the algorithm makes its decisions. Instead of requiring access to the algorithm, we propose making inferences based on the data the algorithm uses. We make four contributions to this problem. First, we link the legal notion of disparate impact to a measure of classification accuracy that while known, has received relatively little attention. Second, we propose a test for disparate impact based on analyzing the information leakage of the protected class from the other data attributes. Third, we describe methods by which data might be made unbiased. Finally, we present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our test for disparate impact and our approach for both masking bias and preserving relevant information in the data. Interestingly, our approach resembles some actual selection practices that have recently received legal scrutiny.},

Moreover, even satisfying all three conditions approximately requires that the data lie in an approximate version of one of the constrained special cases identified by our theorem.

Based on these results, we argue that for successful hate speech detection, model architecture is less important than the type of data and labeling criteria. We further show that all proposed detection techniques are brittle against adversaries who can (automatically) insert typos, change word boundaries or add innocuous words to the original hate speech. A combination of these methods is also effective against Google Perspective -- a cutting-edge solution from industry.

Offensive comments and personal attacks can inhibit participation in these spaces. Automated content moderation aims to overcome this problem using machine learning classifiers trained on large corpora of texts manually annotated for offence. While such systems could help encourage more civil debate, they must navigate inherently normatively contestable boundaries, and are subject to the idiosyncratic norms of the human raters who provide the training data. An important objective for platforms implementing such measures might be to ensure that they are not unduly biased towards or against particular norms of offence. This paper provides some exploratory methods by which the normative biases of algorithmic content moderation systems can be measured, by way of a case study using an existing dataset of comments labelled for offence. We train classifiers on comments labelled by different demographic subsets (men and women) to understand how differences in conceptions of offence between these groups might affect the performance of the resulting models on various test sets. We conclude by discussing some of the ethical choices facing the implementers of algorithmic moderation systems, given various desired levels of diversity of viewpoints amongst discussion participants.},

Recently, Google and Jigsaw started a project called Perspective, which uses machine learning to automatically detect toxic language. A demonstration website has been also launched, which allows anyone to type a phrase in the interface and instantaneously see the toxicity score [1]. In this paper, we propose an attack on the Perspective toxic detection system based on the adversarial examples. We show that an adversary can subtly modify a highly toxic phrase in a way that the system assigns significantly lower toxicity score to it. We apply the attack on the sample phrases provided in the Perspective website and show that we can consistently reduce the toxicity scores to the level of the non-toxic phrases. The existence of such adversarial examples is very harmful for toxic detection systems and seriously undermines their usability.},

The misinterpretation results from the failure to take account of the fact that the data used in existing risk assessment exercises come from environments characterized by informal (and sometimes formal) attempts by judges and other actors to base penal treatments on expected recidivism. Findings of little or no predictive power for baseline covariates may simply indicate the efficient use of the available information. We lay out the problem in detail, provide examples from several literatures and then consider general solutions to the problem.},

	abstract = {At sentencing, youth can be considered both a mitigating circumstance because of its association with diminished culpability and an aggravating circumstance because of its association with crime-risk. In theory, judges and parole boards can recognize this double-edged sword phenomenon and balance the mitigating and aggravating effects of youth. But when sentencing authorities rely on algorithmic risk assessments, a practice that is becoming increasingly common, this balancing process may never take place. Algorithmic risk assessments often place heavy weights on age in a manner that is not fully transparent – or, in the case of proprietary “black-box” algorithms, not transparent at all. For instance, our analysis of one of the leading black-box tools, the COMPAS Violent Recidivism Risk Score, shows that roughly 60\% of the risk score it produces is attributable to age. We argue that this type of fact must be disclosed to sentencing authorities in an easily-interpretable manner so that they understand the role an offender’s age plays in the risk calculation. Failing to reveal that a stigmatic label such as “high risk of violent crime” is due primarily to a defendant’s young age could lead to improper condemnation of a youthful offender, especially given the close association between risk labels and perceptions of character and moral blameworthiness.},

Our fairness constraint requires that an algorithm never prefers one action over another if the long-term (discounted) reward of choosing the latter action is higher. Our ﬁrst result is negative: despite the fact that fairness is consistent with the optimal policy, any learning algorithm satisfying fairness must take time exponential in the number of states to achieve non-trivial approximation to the optimal policy. We then provide a provably fair polynomial time algorithm under an approximate notion of fairness, thus establishing an exponential gap between exact and approximate fairness.},

Classification is best used with non-stochastic/deterministic outcomes that occur frequently, and not when two individuals with identical inputs can easily have different outcomes.},

	abstract = {Modern metropolitan areas involve large concentrations of economic activity and the transport of millions of people each day between their residence and workplace. We use the revolution in transport technology from the invention of steam railways, newly-constructed spatiallydisaggregated data for London from 1801-1921, and a quantitative urban model to provide evidence on the role of these commuting flows in supporting such concentrations of economic activity. Steam railways dramatically reduced travel times and permitted the first large-scale separation of workplace and residence. We show that our model is able to account for the observed changes in the organization of economic activity, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In counterfactuals, we find that removing the entire railway network reduces the population and the value of land and buildings in Greater London by 20 percent or more, and brings down commuting into the City of London from more than 370,000 to less than 60,000 workers.},

	abstract = {In this article we draw on the concept of a social licence to explain public concern at the introduction of care.data, a recent English initiative designed to extract data from primary care medical records for commissioning and other purposes, including research. The concept of a social licence describes how the expectations of society regarding some activities may go beyond compliance with the requirements of formal regulation; those who do not fulfil the conditions for the social licence (even if formally compliant) may experience ongoing challenge and contestation. Previous work suggests that people's cooperation with specific research studies depends on their perceptions that their participation is voluntary and is governed by values of reciprocity, non-exploitation and service of the public good. When these conditions are not seen to obtain, threats to the social licence for research may emerge. We propose that care.data failed to adequately secure a social licence because of: (i) defects in the warrants of trust provided for care.data, (ii) the implied rupture in the traditional role, expectations and duties of general practitioners, and (iii) uncertainty about the status of care.data as a public good. The concept of a social licence may be useful in explaining the specifics of care.data, and also in reinforcing the more general lesson for policy-makers that legal authority does not necessarily command social legitimacy.},

	abstract = {Machine learning for healthcare often trains models on de-identified datasets with randomly-shifted calendar dates, ignoring the fact that data were generated under hospital operation practices that change over time. These changing practices induce definitive changes in observed data which confound evaluations which do not account for dates and limit the generalisability of date-agnostic models. In this work, we establish the magnitude of this problem on MIMIC, a public hospital dataset, and showcase a simple solution. We augment MIMIC with the year in which care was provided and show that a model trained using standard feature representations will significantly degrade in quality over time. We find a deterioration of 0.3 AUC when evaluating mortality prediction on data from 10 years later. We find a similar deterioration of 0.15 AUC for length-of-stay. In contrast, we demonstrate that clinically-oriented aggregates of raw features significantly mitigate future deterioration. Our suggested aggregated representations, when retrained yearly, have prediction quality comparable to year-agnostic models.},

Meehl’s (1954/1996) conclusion that statistical prediction consistently outperforms clinical judgment has stood up extremely well for half a century. His conceptual analyses have not been significantly improved since he published them in the 1950s and 1960s.

	abstract = {Background Pythia is an automated, clinically curated surgical data pipeline and repository housing all surgical patient electronic health record (EHR) data from a large, quaternary, multisite health institute for data science initiatives. In an effort to better identify high-risk surgical patients from complex data, a machine learning project trained on Pythia was built to predict postoperative complication risk. Methods and findings A curated data repository of surgical outcomes was created using automated SQL and R code that extracted and processed patient clinical and surgical data across 37 million clinical encounters from the EHRs. A total of 194 clinical features including patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, race), smoking status, medications, comorbidities, procedure information, and proxies for surgical complexity were constructed and aggregated. A cohort of 66,370 patients that had undergone 99,755 invasive procedural encounters between January 1, 2014, and January 31, 2017, was studied further for the purpose of predicting postoperative complications. The average complication and 30-day postoperative mortality rates of this cohort were 16.0\% and 0.51\%, respectively. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) penalized logistic regression, random forest models, and extreme gradient boosted decision trees were trained on this surgical cohort with cross-validation on 14 specific postoperative outcome groupings. Resulting models had area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) values ranging between 0.747 and 0.924, calculated on an out-of-sample test set from the last 5 months of data. Lasso penalized regression was identified as a high-performing model, providing clinically interpretable actionable insights. Highest and lowest performing lasso models predicted postoperative shock and genitourinary outcomes with AUCs of 0.924 (95\% CI: 0.901, 0.946) and 0.780 (95\% CI: 0.752, 0.810), respectively. A calculator requiring input of 9 data fields was created to produce a risk assessment for the 14 groupings of postoperative outcomes. A high-risk threshold (15\% risk of any complication) was determined to identify high-risk surgical patients. The model sensitivity was 76\%, with a specificity of 76\%. Compared to heuristics that identify high-risk patients developed by clinical experts and the ACS NSQIP calculator, this tool performed superiorly, providing an improved approach for clinicians to estimate postoperative risk for patients. Limitations of this study include the missingness of data that were removed for analysis. Conclusions Extracting and curating a large, local institution’s EHR data for machine learning purposes resulted in models with strong predictive performance. These models can be used in clinical settings as decision support tools for identification of high-risk patients as well as patient evaluation and care management. Further work is necessary to evaluate the impact of the Pythia risk calculator within the clinical workflow on postoperative outcomes and to optimize this data flow for future machine learning efforts.},

	abstract = {Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8,730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

	abstract = {A great deal of theoretical work explores the possibility that algorithms may be biased in one or another respect. But for purposes of law and policy, some of the most important empirical research finds exactly the opposite. In the context of bail decisions, an algorithm designed to predict flight risk does much better than human judges, in large part because the latter place an excessive emphasis on the current offense. Current Offense Bias, as we might call it, is best seen as a cousin of “availability bias,” a well-known source of mistaken probability judgments. The broader lesson is that well-designed algorithms should be able to avoid cognitive biases of many kinds. Existing research on bail decisions also casts a new light on how to think about the risk that algorithms will discriminate on the basis of race (or other factors). Algorithms can easily be designed so as to avoid taking account of race (or other factors). They can also be constrained so as to produce whatever kind of racial balance is sought, and thus to reveal tradeoffs among various social values.},

	abstract = {Machines play increasingly crucial roles in
 establishing facts in legal disputes. Some machines convey
 information—the images of cameras, the measurements of thermometers, the
 opinions of expert systems. When a litigant offers a human assertion for its truth,
 the law subjects it to testimonial safeguards—such as impeachment and the
 hearsay rule—to give juries the context necessary to assess the source’s
 credibility. But the law on machine conveyance is confused: courts shoehorn
 them into existing rules by treating them as “hearsay,” as “real evidence,” or
 as “methods” underlying human expert opinions. These attempts have not been wholly
 unsuccessful, but they are intellectually incoherent and fail to fully empower
 juries to assess machine credibility. This Article seeks to resolve this
 confusion and offer a coherent framework for conceptualizing and regulating machine
 evidence. First, it explains that some machine evidence, like human t…},

	abstract = {The criminal justice system is becoming automated. At every stage, from policing to evidence to parole, machine learning and other computer systems guide outcomes. Widespread debates over the pros and cons of these technologies have overlooked a crucial issue: ownership. Developers often claim that details about how their tools work are trade secrets and refuse to disclose that information to criminal defendants or their attorneys. The introduction of intellectual property claims into the criminal justice system raises under-theorized tensions between life, liberty, and property interests. This Article offers the first wide-ranging account of trade secret evidence in criminal cases, and develops a framework to address the problems that result. In sharp contrast to the general view among trial courts, legislatures, and scholars alike, the Article argues that trade secrets should not be privileged in criminal proceedings. A criminal trade secret privilege is ahistorical; harmful to defendants; and unnecessary to protect the interests of the secret holder. Meanwhile, compared to substantive trade secret law, the privilege overprotects intellectual property. Further, privileging trade secrets in criminal proceedings fails to serve the theoretical purpose of either trade secret law or privilege law. The trade secret inquiry sheds new light on how evidence rules do, and should, function differently in civil and criminal cases.},

This study attempts to provide an overall characterization of YouTube, based on a random sample of channel and video data, by showing how video provision and consumption evolved over the course of the past 10 years. It demonstrates stark contrasts between video genres in terms of channels, uploads and views, and that a vast majority of on average 85\% of all views goes to a small minority of 3\% of all channels. The analytical results give evidence that older channels have a significantly higher probability to garner a large viewership, but also show that there has always been a small chance for young channels to become successful quickly, depending on whether they choose their genre wisely.},

	abstract = {Harmful lies are nothing new. But the ability to distort reality has taken an exponential leap forward with “deep fake” technology. This capability makes it possible to create audio and video of real people saying and doing things they never said or did. Machine learning techniques are escalating the technology’s sophistication, making deep fakes ever more realistic and increasingly resistant to detection. Deep-fake technology has characteristics that enable rapid and widespread diffusion, putting it into the hands of both sophisticated and unsophisticated actors. While deep-fake technology will bring with it certain benefits, it also will introduce many harms. The marketplace of ideas already suffers from truth decay as our networked information environment interacts in toxic ways with our cognitive biases. Deep fakes will exacerbate this problem significantly. Individuals and businesses will face novel forms of exploitation, intimidation, and personal sabotage. The risks to our democracy and to national security are profound as well. Our aim is to provide the first in-depth assessment of the causes and consequences of this disruptive technological change, and to explore the existing and potential tools for responding to it. We survey a broad array of responses, including: the role of technological solutions; criminal penalties, civil liability, and regulatory action; military and covert-action responses; economic sanctions; and market developments. We cover the waterfront from immunities to immutable authentication trails, offering recommendations to improve law and policy and anticipating the pitfalls embedded in various solutions.},

The sentencing community is drawn to this statistical technique because it purportedly distinguishes with greater accuracy the high-risk from the low-risk, and thereby allows for a more efficient allocation of sentencing resources, reserving incarceration for the truly dangerous and saving the low-risk from needless penal attention.},

While such instruments are gaining increasing popularity across the country, their use is attracting tremendous controversy. Much of the controversy concerns potential discriminatory bias in the risk assessments that are produced. This paper discusses several fairness criteria that have recently been applied to assess the fairness of recidivism prediction instruments. We demonstrate that the criteria cannot all be simultaneously satisﬁed when recidivism prevalence diﬀers across groups. We then show how disparate impact can arise when a recidivism prediction instrument fails to satisfy the criterion of error rate balance.},

	abstract = {Decisions based on algorithmic, machine learning models can be unfair, reproducing biases in historical data used to train them. While computational techniques are emerging to address aspects of these concerns through communities such as discrimination-aware data mining (DADM) and fairness, accountability and transparency machine learning (FATML), their practical implementation faces real-world challenges. For legal, institutional or commercial reasons, organisations might not hold the data on sensitive attributes such as gender, ethnicity, sexuality or disability needed to diagnose and mitigate emergent indirect discrimination-by-proxy, such as redlining. Such organisations might also lack the knowledge and capacity to identify and manage fairness issues that are emergent properties of complex sociotechnical systems. This paper presents and discusses three potential approaches to deal with such knowledge and information deficits in the context of fairer machine learning. Trusted third parties could selectively store data necessary for performing discrimination discovery and incorporating fairness constraints into model-building in a privacy-preserving manner. Collaborative online platforms would allow diverse organisations to record, share and access contextual and experiential knowledge to promote fairness in machine learning systems. Finally, unsupervised learning and pedagogically interpretable algorithms might allow fairness hypotheses to be built for further selective testing and exploration. Real-world fairness challenges in machine learning are not abstract, constrained optimisation problems, but are institutionally and contextually grounded. Computational fairness tools are useful, but must be researched and developed in and with the messy contexts that will shape their deployment, rather than just for imagined situations. Not doing so risks real, near-term algorithmic harm.},

	abstract = {This article investigates the claims and complexities involved in the platform-based economics of health and fitness apps. We examine a double-edged logic inscribed in these platforms, promising to offer personal solutions to medical problems while also contributing to the public good. On the one hand, online platforms serve as personalized data-driven services to their customers. On the other hand, they allegedly serve public interests, such as medical research or health education. In doing so, many apps employ a diffuse discourse, hinging on terms like “sharing,” “open,” and “reuse” when they talk about data extraction and distribution. The analytical approach we adopt in this article is situated at the nexus of science and technology studies, political economy, and the sociology of health and illness. The analysis concentrates on two aspects: datafication (the use and reuse of data) and commodification (a platform’s deployment of governance and business models). We apply these analytical categories to three specific platforms: 23andMe, PatientsLikeMe, and Parkinson mPower. The last section will connect these individual examples to the wider implications of health apps’ data flows, governance policies, and business models. Regulatory bodies commonly focus on the (medical) safety and security of apps, but pay scarce attention to health apps’ techno-economic governance. Who owns user-generated health data and who gets to benefit? We argue that it is important to reflect on the societal implications of health data markets. Governments have the duty to provide conceptual clarity in the grand narrative of transforming health care and health research.},

	abstract = {Improving the quality of end-of-life care for hospitalized patients is a priority for healthcare organizations. Studies have shown that physicians tend to over-estimate prognoses, which in combination with treatment inertia results in a mismatch between patients wishes and actual care at the end of life. We describe a method to address this problem using Deep Learning and Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, which is currently being piloted, with Institutional Review Board approval, at an academic medical center. The EHR data of admitted patients are automatically evaluated by an algorithm, which brings patients who are likely to benefit from palliative care services to the attention of the Palliative Care team. The algorithm is a Deep Neural Network trained on the EHR data from previous years, to predict all-cause 3-12 month mortality of patients as a proxy for patients that could benefit from palliative care. Our predictions enable the Palliative Care team to take a proactive approach in reaching out to such patients, rather than relying on referrals from treating physicians, or conduct time consuming chart reviews of all patients. We also present a novel interpretation technique which we use to provide explanations of the model's predictions.},

Using the example of media rankings of law schools, this article argues that the methodological concept of reactivity—the idea that people change their behavior in reaction to being evaluated, observed, or measured—offers a useful lens for disclosing how these measures effect change. A framework is proposed for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms, self‐fulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity. This approach demonstrates how these increasingly fateful public measures change expectations and permeate institutions, suggesting why it is important for scholars to investigate the impact of these measures more systematically.},

One of the companies aspiring to pioneer these advances is DeepMind Technologies Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Google conglomerate, Alphabet Inc. In 2016, DeepMind announced its first major health project: a collaboration with the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, to assist in the management of acute kidney injury. Initially received with great enthusiasm, the collaboration has suffered from a lack of clarity and openness, with issues of privacy and power emerging as potent challenges as the project has unfolded. Taking the DeepMind-Royal Free case study as its pivot, this article draws a number of lessons on the transfer of population-derived datasets to large private prospectors, identifying critical questions for policy-makers, industry and individuals as healthcare moves into an algorithmic age.},

What will the dominance of ML diagnostics mean for medical malpractice law, for the future of medical service provision, for the demand for certain kinds of doctors, and—in the longer run—for the quality of medical diagnostics itself?This article argues that once ML diagnosticians, such as those based on neural networks, are shown to be superior, existing medical malpractice law will require superior ML-generated medical diagnostics as the standard of care in clinical settings. Further, unless implemented carefully, a physician’s duty to use ML systems in medical diagnostics could, paradoxically, undermine the very safety standard that malpractice law set out to achieve. In time, effective machine learning could create overwhelming legal and ethical pressure to delegate the diagnostic process to the machine. Ultimately, a similar dynamic might extend to treatment also. If we reach the point where the bulk of clinical outcomes collected in databases are ML-generated diagnoses, this may result in future decision scenarios that are not easily audited or understood by human doctors.  Given the well-documented fact that treatment strategies are often not as effective when deployed in real clinical practice compared to preliminary evaluation, the lack of transparency introduced by the ML algorithms could lead to a decrease in quality of care. The article describes salient technical aspects of this scenario particularly as it relates to diagnosis and canvasses various possible technical and legal solutions that would allow us to avoid these unintended consequences of medical malpractice law. Ultimately, we suggest there is a strong case for altering existing medical liability rules in order to avoid a machine-only diagnostic regime. We argue that the appropriate revision to the standard of care requires the maintenance of meaningful participation by physicians in the loop.},

We trace how the notion of fairness has been defined within the testing communities of education and hiring over the past half century, exploring the cultural and social context in which different fairness definitions have emerged. In some cases, earlier definitions of fairness are similar or identical to definitions of fairness in current machine learning research, and foreshadow current formal work. In other cases, insights into what fairness means and how to measure it have largely gone overlooked. We compare past and current notions of fairness along several dimensions, including the fairness criteria, the focus of the criteria (e.g., a test, a model, or its use), the relationship of fairness to individuals, groups, and subgroups, and the mathematical method for measuring fairness (e.g., classification, regression). This work points the way towards future research and measurement of (un)fairness that builds from our modern understanding of fairness while incorporating insights from the past.},

	abstract = {This article evaluates the job quality of work in the remote gig economy. Such work consists of the remote provision of a wide variety of digital services mediated by online labour platforms. Focusing on workers in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the article draws on semi-structured interviews in six countries (N = 107) and a cross-regional survey (N = 679) to detail the manner in which remote gig work is shaped by platform-based algorithmic control. Despite varying country contexts and types of work, we show that algorithmic control is central to the operation of online labour platforms. Algorithmic management techniques tend to offer workers high levels of flexibility, autonomy, task variety and complexity. However, these mechanisms of control can also result in low pay, social isolation, working unsocial and irregular hours, overwork, sleep deprivation and exhaustion.},

	abstract = {Scholars in several fields, including quantitative methodologists, legal scholars, and theoretically oriented criminologists, have launched robust debates about the fairness of quantitative risk assessment. As the Supreme Court considers addressing constitutional questions on the issue, we propose a framework for understanding the relationships among these debates: layers of bias. In the top layer, we identify challenges to fairness within the risk-assessment models themselves. We explain types of statistical fairness and the tradeoffs between them. The second layer covers biases embedded in data. Using data from a racially biased criminal justice system can lead to unmeasurable biases in both risk scores and outcome measures. The final layer engages conceptual problems with risk models: Is it fair to make criminal justice decisions about individuals based on groups? We show that each layer depends on the layers below it: Without assurances about the foundational layers, the fairness of the top layers is irrelevant.},

	abstract = {Although algorithmic auditing has emerged as a key strategy to expose systematic biases embedded in software platforms, we struggle to understand the realworld impact of these audits, as scholarship on the impact of algorithmic audits on increasing algorithmic fairness and transparency in commercial systems is nascent. To analyze the impact of publicly naming and disclosing performance results of biased AI systems, we investigate the commercial impact of Gender Shades, the ﬁrst algorithmic audit of gender and skin type performance disparities in commercial facial analysis models. This paper 1) outlines the audit design and structured disclosure procedure used in the Gender Shades study, 2) presents new performance metrics from targeted companies IBM, Microsoft and Megvii (Face++) on the Pilot Parliaments Benchmark (PPB) as of August 2018, 3) provides performance results on PPB by non-target companies Amazon and Kairos and, 4) explores differences in company responses as shared through corporate communications that contextualize differences in performance on PPB. Within 7 months of the original audit, we ﬁnd that all three targets released new API versions. All targets reduced accuracy disparities between males and females and darker and lighter-skinned subgroups, with the most signiﬁcant update occurring for the darker-skinned female subgroup, that underwent a 17.7\% - 30.4\% reduction in error between audit periods. Minimizing these disparities led to a 5.72\% to 8.3\% reduction in overall error on the Pilot Parliaments Benchmark (PPB) for target corporation APIs. The overall performance of non-targets Amazon and Kairos lags signiﬁcantly behind that of the targets, with error rates of 8.66\% and 6.60\% overall, and error rates of 31.37\% and 22.50\% for the darker female subgroup, respectively.},

	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3341661},
	abstract = {The concept of “information fiduciaries” has surged to the forefront of debates on online platform regulation. Developed by Professor Jack Balkin, the concept is meant to rebalance the relationship between ordinary individuals and the digital companies that accumulate, analyze, and sell their personal data for profit. Just as the law imposes special duties of care, confidentiality, and loyalty on doctors, lawyers, and accountants vis-à-vis their patients and clients, Balkin argues, so too should it impose special duties on corporations such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter vis-à-vis their end users. Over the past several years, this argument has garnered remarkably broad support and essentially zero critical pushback.This Essay seeks to disrupt the emerging consensus by identifying a number of lurking tensions and ambiguities in the theory of information fiduciaries, as well as a number of reasons to doubt the theory’s capacity to resolve them satisfactorily. Although we agree with Balkin that the harms stemming from dominant online platforms call for legal intervention, we question whether the concept of information fiduciaries is an adequate or apt response to the problems of information insecurity that he stresses, much less to more fundamental problems associated with outsized market share and business models built on pervasive surveillance. We also call attention to the potential costs of adopting an information-fiduciary framework—a framework that, we fear, invites an enervating complacency toward online platforms’ structural power and a premature abandonment of more robust visions of public regulation.},

While defenses that cause obfuscated gradients appear to defeat iterative optimization-based attacks, we find defenses relying on this effect can be circumvented. We describe characteristic behaviors of defenses exhibiting the effect, and for each of the three types of obfuscated gradients we discover, we develop attack techniques to overcome it. In a case study, examining non-certified white-box-secure defenses at ICLR 2018, we find obfuscated gradients are a common occurrence, with 7 of 9 defenses relying on obfuscated gradients. Our new attacks successfully circumvent 6 completely, and 1 partially, in the original threat model each paper considers.},

	title = {Adversarial examples in the physical world},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02533},
	abstract = {Most existing machine learning classifiers are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. An adversarial example is a sample of input data which has been modified very slightly in a way that is intended to cause a machine learning classifier to misclassify it. In many cases, these modifications can be so subtle that a human observer does not even notice the modification at all, yet the classifier still makes a mistake. Adversarial examples pose security concerns because they could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems, even if the adversary has no access to the underlying model. Up to now, all previous work have assumed a threat model in which the adversary can feed data directly into the machine learning classifier. This is not always the case for systems operating in the physical world, for example those which are using signals from cameras and other sensors as an input. This paper shows that even in such physical world scenarios, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples. We demonstrate this by feeding adversarial images obtained from cell-phone camera to an ImageNet Inception classifier and measuring the classification accuracy of the system. We find that a large fraction of adversarial examples are classified incorrectly even when perceived through the camera.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05526v1},
	abstract = {Deep learning models have achieved high performance on many tasks, and thus
have been applied to many security-critical scenarios. For example, deep
learning-based face recognition systems have been used to authenticate users to
access many security-sensitive applications like payment apps. Such usages of
deep learning systems provide the adversaries with sufficient incentives to
perform attacks against these systems for their adversarial purposes. In this
work, we consider a new type of attacks, called backdoor attacks, where the
attacker's goal is to create a backdoor into a learning-based authentication
system, so that he can easily circumvent the system by leveraging the backdoor.
Specifically, the adversary aims at creating backdoor instances, so that the
victim learning system will be misled to classify the backdoor instances as a
target label specified by the adversary. In particular, we study backdoor
poisoning attacks, which achieve backdoor attacks using poisoning strategies.
Different from all existing work, our studied poisoning strategies can apply
under a very weak threat model: (1) the adversary has no knowledge of the model
and the training set used by the victim system; (2) the attacker is allowed to
inject only a small amount of poisoning samples; (3) the backdoor key is hard
to notice even by human beings to achieve stealthiness. We conduct evaluation
to demonstrate that a backdoor adversary can inject only around 50 poisoning
samples, while achieving an attack success rate of above 90\%. We are also the
first work to show that a data poisoning attack can create physically
implementable backdoors without touching the training process. Our work
demonstrates that backdoor poisoning attacks pose real threats to a learning
system, and thus highlights the importance of further investigation and
proposing defense strategies against them.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12177v1},
	abstract = {Deep convolutional network architectures are often assumed to guarantee
generalization for small image translations and deformations. In this paper we
show that modern CNNs (VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2) can drastically
change their output when an image is translated in the image plane by a few
pixels, and that this failure of generalization also happens with other
realistic small image transformations. Furthermore, the deeper the network the
more we see these failures to generalize. We show that these failures are
related to the fact that the architecture of modern CNNs ignores the classical
sampling theorem so that generalization is not guaranteed. We also show that
biases in the statistics of commonly used image datasets makes it unlikely that
CNNs will learn to be invariant to these transformations. Taken together our
results suggest that the performance of CNNs in object recognition falls far
short of the generalization capabilities of humans.},

This writing investigates the delivery of these kinds of ads by Google AdSense using a sample of racially associated names and finds statistically significant discrimination in ad delivery based on searches of 2184 racially associated personal names across two websites. First names, assigned at birth to more black or white babies, are found predictive of race (88\% black, 96\% white), and those assigned primarily to black babies, such as DeShawn, Darnell and Jermaine, generated ads suggestive of an arrest in 81 to 86 percent of name searches on one website and 92 to 95 percent on the other, while those assigned at birth primarily to whites, such as Geoffrey, Jill and Emma, generated more neutral copy: the word "arrest" appeared in 23 to 29 percent of name searches on one site and 0 to 60 percent on the other. On the more ad trafficked website, a black-identifying name was 25\% more likely to get an ad suggestive of an arrest record. A few names did not follow these patterns. All ads return results for actual individuals and ads appear regardless of whether the name has an arrest record in the company's database. The company maintains Google received the same ad text for groups of last names (not first names), raising questions as to whether Google's technology exposes racial bias.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10861},
	abstract = {The existence of adversarial examples in which an imperceptible change in the input can fool well trained neural networks was experimentally discovered by Szegedy et al in 2013, who called them "Intriguing properties of neural networks". Since then, this topic had become one of the hottest research areas within machine learning, but the ease with which we can switch between any two decisions in targeted attacks is still far from being understood, and in particular it is not clear which parameters determine the number of input coordinates we have to change in order to mislead the network. In this paper we develop a simple mathematical framework which enables us to think about this baffling phenomenon from a fresh perspective, turning it into a natural consequence of the geometry of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n\$ with the \$L\_0\$ (Hamming) metric, which can be quantitatively analyzed. In particular, we explain why we should expect to find targeted adversarial examples with Hamming distance of roughly \$m\$ in arbitrarily deep neural networks which are designed to distinguish between \$m\$ input classes.},

Yet such failures are mostly studied in the context of real-world images with calibrated attacks. To demystify the adversarial examples, rigorous studies need to be designed. Unfortunately, complexity of the medical images hinders such study design directly from the medical images. We hypothesize that adversarial examples might result from the incorrect mapping of image space to the low dimensional generation manifold by deep networks. To test the hypothesis, we simplify a complex medical problem namely pose estimation of surgical tools into its barest form. An analytical decision boundary and exhaustive search of the one-pixel attack across multiple image dimensions let us localize the regions of frequent successful one-pixel attacks at the image space.},

The match had many bizarre incidents. Karpov's team included a Dr. Zukhar (a well known hypnotist), while Korchnoi adopted two local renegades currently on bail for attempted murder. There was more controversy off the board, with histrionics ranging from X-raying of chairs, protests about the flags used on the board, the inevitable hypnotism complaints and the mirror glasses used by Korchnoi. When Karpov's team sent him a blueberry yogurt during a game without any request for one by Karpov, the Korchnoi team protested, claiming it could be some kind of code. They later said this was intended as a parody of earlier protests, but it was taken seriously at the time.In quality of play, the match itself never measured up to the press headlines that it generated, although as a sporting contest it had its share of excitement. The match would go to the first player to win six games, draws not counting. After 17 games, Karpov had a 4–1 lead. Korchnoi won game 21, but Karpov won game 27, putting him on the brink of victory with a 5–2 lead. Korchnoi fought back, scoring three wins and one draw in the next four games, to equalise the match at 5–5 after 31 games. However, Karpov won the very next game, and the match, by 6–5 with 21 draws.},

In contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go, by tabula rasa reinforcement learning from games of self-play. In this paper, we generalise this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve, tabula rasa, superhuman performance in many challenging domains. Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.},

Despite such growing scholarly interests, however, little evidence exists on the role Big Data can play in improving government service. We undertake one of the first quantitative studies revealing the potential utility and limitations of “Big Data-based policymaking” by exploring its recent use by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. In 2013, the government introduced the “Owl Bus”—a late-night bus system—the routes of which were selected based on government analyses of Big Data relating to citizens’ late-night taxi and mobile phone use. The findings suggest that the average number of passengers utilizing the Owl Bus routes was significantly greater than that on other daytime bus routes with comparable characteristics. That said, we also present the potential limitations of evidence-based policymaking in general, especially when politics and equity considerations are factored in.},

	abstract = {Among the structural elements that enable social media platforms to durably influence our moods and behaviour, their answering a widespread desire to be liked and accepted - a desire which is seldom transparent to us - greatly increases their manipulative power. So does their ability to harvest fine-grained information about their users (and acquaintances). This data puts such platforms in a position where they can not only covertly influence our thoughts, moods and behaviour: they can do so in a way that is maximally effective given our respective traits, vulnerabilities etc. This paper argues that if we are to stand any chance of taming these platforms’ considerable manipulative potential, some conceptual spring-cleaning is needed. First, we need to stop confusing regulatory power and regulation. Whereas in mechanics or cybernetics there is no need to distinguish between the two -since there are no agents whose autonomy is infringed by regulation- when the concept of regulation is applied to human behaviour this distinction becomes crucial, and hinges upon the concept of authority. Since social media platforms do not - yet - claim authority, they do not regulate us: they have regulatory power over us. Our task is to regulate that power.To succeed in the latter task, we also need to acknowledge that the type of influence exercised by social media platforms is not merely non-deliberative: it is also covert. While the former is often unproblematic from an ethical/legal perspective, the latter not only threatens our right to freedom of thought, it also compromises our commitment to moral equality.},

However, the promise of accurate personalized medicine can only be fulfilled with access to large quantities of medical data from patients. This data could be used for purposes such as predicting disease, diagnosis, treatment optimization, and prognostication. Radiology is positioned to lead development and implementation of AI algorithms and to manage the associated ethical and legal challenges. This white paper from the Canadian Association of Radiologists provides a framework for study of the legal and ethical issues related to AI in medical imaging, related to patient data (privacy, confidentiality, ownership, and sharing); algorithms (levels of autonomy, liability, and jurisprudence); practice (best practices and current legal framework); and finally, opportunities in AI from the perspective of a universal health care system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The complexity of these formations tends to camouflage their predatory character. Further, such formations are systemic in nature. They are not produced by an elementary seizure of power. Predatory formations are often beyond the reach of ordinary policy responses, in good part because they tend to assemble elements of separate domains into novel configurations. The focus here is on one of the more powerful and complex predatory formations, (high) finance. And the effort is to explain how even the most sophisticated financial instruments require certain elementary and brutal steps, resulting in highly degraded socio-economic outcomes. The sub-prime mortgage developed in the early 2000s differentiates itself from the original 1970s concept in that its aim was not to enable access to housing. Its aim was and is to use the actual physical good (the house) to develop an asset-backed security for the financial system itself.},

robustness and that of standard generalization. Specifically, training robust
models may not only be more resource-consuming, but also lead to a reduction of
standard accuracy. We demonstrate that this trade-off between the standard
accuracy of a model and its robustness to adversarial perturbations provably
exists even in a fairly simple and natural setting. These findings also
corroborate a similar phenomenon observed in practice. Further, we argue that
this phenomenon is a consequence of robust classifiers learning fundamentally
different feature representations than standard classifiers. These differences,
in particular, seem to result in unexpected benefits: the representations
learned by robust models tend to align better with salient data characteristics
and human perception.},

	abstract = {Biological evolution provides a creative fount of complex and subtle
adaptations, often surprising the scientists who discover them. However,
because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in
which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many
researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving
algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized
bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes
uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal
creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the
standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles
to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The
stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but
that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and
outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only
among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how
interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution
can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published
before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of
artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand
accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of
scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also
present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of
evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a
universal property of all complex evolving systems.},

	abstract = {Algorithmic fairness, and in particular the fairness of scoring and classification algorithms, has become a topic of increasing social concern and has recently witnessed an explosion of research in theoretical computer science, machine learning, statistics, the social sciences, and law. Much of the literature considers the case of a single classifier (or scoring function) used once, in isolation. In this work, we initiate the study of the fairness properties of systems composed of algorithms that are fair in isolation; that is, we study fairness under composition. We identify pitfalls of naive composition and give general constructions for fair composition, demonstrating both that classifiers that are fair in isolation do not necessarily compose into fair systems and also that seemingly unfair components may be carefully combined to construct fair systems. We focus primarily on the individual fairness setting proposed in [Dwork, Hardt, Pitassi, Reingold, Zemel, 2011], but also extend our results to a large class of group fairness definitions popular in the recent literature, exhibiting several cases in which group fairness definitions give misleading signals under composition.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02095},
	abstract = {The enormous financial success of online advertising platforms is partially due to the precise targeting features they offer. Although researchers and journalists have found many ways that advertisers can target---or exclude---particular groups of users seeing their ads, comparatively little attention has been paid to the implications of the platform's ad delivery process, comprised of the platform's choices about who should see an ad. It has been hypothesized that this process can "skew" ad delivery in ways that the advertisers do not intend, making some users less likely than others to see particular ads based on their demographic characteristics. In this paper, we demonstrate that such skewed delivery occurs on Facebook, due to market and financial optimization effects as well as the platform's own predictions about the "relevance" of ads to different groups of users. We find that both the advertiser's budget and the content of the ad each significantly contribute to the skew of Facebook's ad delivery. Critically, we observe significant skew in delivery along gender and racial lines for "real" ads for employment and housing opportunities despite neutral targeting parameters. Our results demonstrate previously unknown mechanisms that can lead to potentially discriminatory ad delivery, even when advertisers set their targeting parameters to be highly inclusive. This underscores the need for policymakers and platforms to carefully consider the role of the ad delivery optimization run by ad platforms themselves---and not just the targeting choices of advertisers---in preventing discrimination in digital advertising.},

	shorttitle = {Horovod},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05799},
	abstract = {Training modern deep learning models requires large amounts of computation, often provided by GPUs. Scaling computation from one GPU to many can enable much faster training and research progress but entails two complications. First, the training library must support inter-GPU communication. Depending on the particular methods employed, this communication may entail anywhere from negligible to significant overhead. Second, the user must modify his or her training code to take advantage of inter-GPU communication. Depending on the training library's API, the modification required may be either significant or minimal. Existing methods for enabling multi-GPU training under the TensorFlow library entail non-negligible communication overhead and require users to heavily modify their model-building code, leading many researchers to avoid the whole mess and stick with slower single-GPU training. In this paper we introduce Horovod, an open source library that improves on both obstructions to scaling: it employs efficient inter-GPU communication via ring reduction and requires only a few lines of modification to user code, enabling faster, easier distributed training in TensorFlow. Horovod is available under the Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/uber/horovod},

Secondly, it gives an account of FRS's, the algorithms upon which they are based, and the biases embedded therein. In the third part, the ways in which these biases may manifest itself in real world implementation of FRS’s are outlined. Finally, some policy suggestions for the future development of FRS’s are made; it is noted that the most common critiques of such systems are based on notions of privacy which seem increasingly at odds with the world of automated systems.},

The deep learning aided privacy attack can dig out sensitive personal information not only from the text but also from unstructured data such as images and videos. In this paper, we proposed a framework to protect image privacy against the deep learning tools. We also propose two new metrics to measure the image privacy. Moreover, we propose two different image privacy protection schemes based on the two metrics, utilizing the adversarial example idea. The performance of our schemes is validated by simulation on a large-scale dataset. Our study shows that we can protect the image privacy by adding a small amount of noise, while the added noise has a humanly imperceptible impact on the image quality.},

We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underﬁts WebText. Samples from the model reﬂect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These ﬁndings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.},

Often in such problems fairness is also a concern. One natural notion of fairness, based on general principles of equality of opportunity, asks that conditional on an individual being a candidate for the resource in question, the probability of actually receiving it is approximately independent of the individual’s group. For example, in lending this would mean that equally creditworthy individuals in different racial groups have roughly equal chances of receiving a loan. In policing it would mean that two individuals committing the same crime in different districts would have roughly equal chances of being arrested.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023},
	abstract = {The nascent field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last several years, three formal definitions of fairness have gained prominence: (1) anti-classification, meaning that protected attributes---like race, gender, and their proxies---are not explicitly used to make decisions; (2) classification parity, meaning that common measures of predictive performance (e.g., false positive and false negative rates) are equal across groups defined by the protected attributes; and (3) calibration, meaning that conditional on risk estimates, outcomes are independent of protected attributes. Here we show that all three of these fairness definitions suffer from significant statistical limitations. Requiring anti-classification or classification parity can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect; and calibration, though generally desirable, provides little guarantee that decisions are equitable. In contrast to these formal fairness criteria, we argue that it is often preferable to treat similarly risky people similarly, based on the most statistically accurate estimates of risk that one can produce. Such a strategy, while not universally applicable, often aligns well with policy objectives; notably, this strategy will typically violate both anti-classification and classification parity. In practice, it requires significant effort to construct suitable risk estimates. One must carefully define and measure the targets of prediction to avoid retrenching biases in the data. But, importantly, one cannot generally address these difficulties by requiring that algorithms satisfy popular mathematical formalizations of fairness. By highlighting these challenges in the foundation of fair machine learning, we hope to help researchers and practitioners productively advance the area.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.03.006},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Determine how varying longitudinal historical training data can impact prediction of future clinical decisions. Estimate the "decay rate" of clinical data source relevance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We trained a clinical order recommender system, analogous to Netflix or Amazon's "Customers who bought A also bought B..." product recommenders, based on a tertiary academic hospital's structured electronic health record data. We used this system to predict future (2013) admission orders based on different subsets of historical training data (2009 through 2012), relative to existing human-authored order sets.
RESULTS: Predicting future (2013) inpatient orders is more accurate with models trained on just one month of recent (2012) data than with 12 months of older (2009) data (ROC AUC 0.91 vs. 0.88, precision 27\% vs. 22\%, recall 52\% vs. 43\%, all P{\textless}10-10). Algorithmically learned models from even the older (2009) data was still more effective than existing human-authored order sets (ROC AUC 0.81, precision 16\% recall 35\%). Training with more longitudinal data (2009-2012) was no better than using only the most recent (2012) data, unless applying a decaying weighting scheme with a "half-life" of data relevance about 4 months.
DISCUSSION: Clinical practice patterns (automatically) learned from electronic health record data can vary substantially across years. Gold standards for clinical decision support are elusive moving targets, reinforcing the need for automated methods that can adapt to evolving information.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCM: Prioritizing small amounts of recent data is more effective than using larger amounts of older data towards future clinical predictions.},

	abstract = {There are two fundamental features of the information processing behind most efforts to substitute artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics for professionals in health and education: reductionism and functionalism. However, true professional judgment hinges on a way of knowing the world and relating to persons that is at odds with the mindset of substitutive automation. Instead of reductionism, an encompassing holism is a hallmark of professional practice — an ability to integrate facts and values, to respect the demands of the particular case and prerogatives of society, and to balance mission and margin in institutional decision-making. Any presently plausible vision of substituting artificial intelligence for education and health care professionals would be premised on patients and students accepting services as “medical care” or “education” that are often far inferior to what a skilled, reflective practitioner in either field could provide. The only way these sectors can progress is to maintain, at their core, a large (and likely growing) core of professionals capable of carefully intermediating between technology and the patients it would help treat, or the students it would help learn. As critical data studies have repeatedly shown, the lifeblood of AI ambitions — data — is neither brute nor given. Deciding what data matters, how it is fairly and accurately collected, and how to balance quantitative and qualitative approaches to the representation of situations, will be critical and enduring roles for professionals.},

	abstract = {ContextHealth plan utilization review rules are intended to enforce insurance contracts and can alter and constrain the services that physicians provide to their patients. Physicians can manipulate these rules, but how often they do so is unknown.ObjectiveTo determine the frequency with which physicians manipulate reimbursement rules to obtain coverage for services they perceive as necessary, and the physician attitudes and personal and practice characteristics associated with these manipulations.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA random national sample of 1124 practicing physicians was surveyed by mail in 1998; the response rate was 64\% (n = 720).Main Outcome MeasureUse of 3 different tactics "sometimes" or more often in the last year: (1) exaggerating the severity of patients' conditions; (2) changing patients' billing diagnoses; and/or (3) reporting signs or symptoms that patients did not have to help the patients secure coverage for needed care.ResultsThirty-nine percent of physicians reported using at least 1 tactic "sometimes" or more often in the last year. In multivariate models comparing these physicians with physicians who "never" or "rarely" used any of these tactics, physicians using these tactics were more likely to (1) believe that "gaming the system" is necessary to provide high-quality care today (odds ratio [OR], 3.67; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.54-5.29); (2) have received requests from patients to deceive insurers (OR, 2.44; 95\% CI, 1.72-3.45); (3) feel pressed for time during patient visits (OR, 1.69; 95\% CI, 1.21-2.37); and (4) have more than 25\% of their patients covered by Medicaid (OR, 1.60; 95\% CI, 1.08-2.38). Notably, greater worry about prosecution for fraud did not affect physicians' use of these tactics (P = .34). Of those reporting using these tactics, 54\% reported doing so more often now than 5 years ago.ConclusionsA sizable minority of physicians report manipulating reimbursement rules so patients can receive care that physicians perceive is necessary. Unless novel strategies are developed to address this, greater utilization restrictions in the health care system are likely to increase physicians' use of such manipulative "covert advocacy" tactics.},

	abstract = {Advances in machine learning have led to broad deployment of systems with impressive performance on important problems. Nonetheless, these systems can be induced to make errors on data that are surprisingly similar to examples the learned system handles correctly. The existence of these errors raises a variety of questions about out-of-sample generalization and whether bad actors might use such examples to abuse deployed systems. As a result of these security concerns, there has been a flurry of recent papers proposing algorithms to defend against such malicious perturbations of correctly handled examples. It is unclear how such misclassifications represent a different kind of security problem than other errors, or even other attacker-produced examples that have no specific relationship to an uncorrupted input. In this paper, we argue that adversarial example defense papers have, to date, mostly considered abstract, toy games that do not relate to any specific security concern. Furthermore, defense papers have not yet precisely described all the abilities and limitations of attackers that would be relevant in practical security. Towards this end, we establish a taxonomy of motivations, constraints, and abilities for more plausible adversaries. Finally, we provide a series of recommendations outlining a path forward for future work to more clearly articulate the threat model and perform more meaningful evaluation.},

	abstract = {Each year, millions of automobile crashes occur when drivers fail to notice and respond to conflicts with other vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Today, manufacturers race to deploy automation technologies to help eliminate these mishaps. To date, little effort has been made to educate drivers about how these systems work or how they affect driver behavior. Driver education for automated systems amounts to additional pages in an owner’s manual that is known to be a seldom-used glove box reference. In this article, we review the history of automation deployed in the airline cockpit decades ago. We describe how automation helped avoid many common crash scenarios but at the same time gave rise to new kinds of crashes. It was only following a concerted effort to educate pilots about the automation, about themselves, and about the concept of a human-automation team that we reached the near-zero crash rate we enjoy today. Drawing parallels between the automation systems, the available pilot and driver research, and operational experience in both airplanes and automobiles, we outline knowledge standards for drivers of partially automated cars and argue that the safe operation of these vehicles will be enhanced by drivers’ incorporation of this knowledge in their everyday travels.},

	abstract = {This article addresses emerging gaps in consumer protection. As is true in other industries, insurers are revolutionizing their practices with artificial intelligence and big data. Insurers are finding new ways to price risks and policies, tailor coverage, offer advice to purchasers, identify fraud, and sequence the payment of claims. Regulators are struggling to keep up with these changes and these changes have subverted the protections for consumers built into current regulatory regimes.This is not a niche problem. Insurance regulation is a necessary part of solving complex market failures in this vital industry. Insurance is a critical part of the United States economy, raking in over 1.2 trillion dollars in premiums a year; employing more than 2.5 million people; and undergirding transactions as simple as home purchases and as complex as corporate mergers and acquisitions, the multi-trillion-dollar tort system, and a vast system of private risk management and loss avoidance advice. The market for insurance is, however, surprisingly inefficient. Deep information asymmetries make it difficult for consumers to evaluate the quality of policies and carriers, insurers to price risks properly, and make it possible for both sides to act opportunistically. What’s more, behavioral barriers hamper purchasers, who often buy too little or the wrong insurance. And, in some markets, private insurers might not be willing to supply enough insurance because the underlying risks cannot be adequately spread. Most of the previous legal scholarship about algorithmic justice has been in the context of information platforms, criminal justice, and employment discrimination. This article connects to those discussions and expands them in the specific context of insurance. It does so by providing a taxonomy of the changes in the insurance industry, the potential danger to consumers as a result of those changes, the reasons for regulation, and the ways that regulators must adapt to protect individual consumers and the insurance market.},

	abstract = {The discovery of adversarial examples has raised concerns about the practical deployment of deep learning systems. In this paper, we demonstrate that adversarial examples are capable of manipulating deep learning systems across three clinical domains. For each of our representative medical deep learning classifiers, both white and black box attacks were highly successful. Our models are representative of the current state of the art in medical computer vision and, in some cases, directly reflect architectures already seeing deployment in real world clinical settings. In addition to the technical contribution of our paper, we synthesize a large body of knowledge about the healthcare system to argue that medicine may be uniquely susceptible to adversarial attacks, both in terms of monetary incentives and technical vulnerability. To this end, we outline the healthcare economy and the incentives it creates for fraud and provide concrete examples of how and why such attacks could be realistically carried out. We urge practitioners to be aware of current vulnerabilities when deploying deep learning systems in clinical settings, and encourage the machine learning community to further investigate the domain-specific characteristics of medical learning systems.},

	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3350508},
	abstract = {Negligence law is often asked to adapt to new technologies. So it is with artificial intelligence (AI). But AI is different. Drawing on examples in medicine, financial advice, data security, and driving in semi-autonomous vehicles, this Article argues that AI poses serious challenges for negligence law. By inserting a layer of inscrutable, unintuitive, and statistically-derived code in between a human decisionmaker and the consequences of that decision, AI disrupts our typical understanding of responsibility for choices gone wrong. The Article argues that AI’s unique nature introduces four complications into negligence: 1) unforeseeability of specific errors that AI will make; 2) capacity limitations when humans interact with AI; 3) introducing AI-specific software vulnerabilities into decisions not previously mediated by software; and 4) distributional concerns based on AI’s statistical nature and potential for bias.Tort scholars have mostly overlooked these challenges. This is understandable because they have been focused on autonomous robots, especially autonomous vehicles, which can easily kill, maim, or injure people. But this focus has neglected to consider the full range of what AI is. Outside of robots, AI technologies are not autonomous. Rather, they are primarily decision-assistance tools that aim to improve on the inefficiency, arbitrariness, and bias of human decisions. By focusing on a technology that eliminates users, tort scholars have concerned themselves with product liability and innovation, and as a result, have missed the implications for negligence law, the governing regime when harm comes from users of AI.The Article also situates these observations in broader themes of negligence law: the relationship between bounded rationality and foreseeability, the need to update reasonableness conceptions based on new technology, and the difficulties of merging statistical facts with individual determinations, such as fault. This analysis suggests that though there might be a way to create systems of regulatory support to allow negligence law to operate as intended, an approach to oversight that it not based in individual fault is likely to be a more fruitful approach.},

	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3347890},
	abstract = {Artificial intelligence will transform medicine.  One particularly attractive possibility is the democratization of medical expertise.  If black-box medical algorithms can be trained to match the performance of high-level human experts—to identify malignancies as well as trained radiologists, to diagnose diabetic retinopathy as well as board-certified ophthalmologists, or to recommend tumor-specific courses of treatment as well as top-ranked oncologists—then those algorithms could be deployed in medical settings where human experts are not available, and patients could benefit.       But there is a problem with this vision.  Privacy law, malpractice, insurance reimbursement, and FDA approval standards all encourage developers to train medical AI in high-resource contexts, such as academic medical centers.  And put simply, care is different in high-resource settings than it is in low-resource settings such as community health centers or rural providers in less-developed countries.  Patient populations differ, as do the resources available to administer treatment and the resources available to pay for that treatment.  This development pattern will lead to decreases in the quality of the algorithm’s recommendations, reflected in problematic care and increased costs.  Perniciously, such quality problems in low-resource contexts are likely to go unrecognized for exactly the same reasons that promote algorithmic training in high-resource contexts.     Solutions are not trivial.  Labeling products the same way that drugs are labeled is unlikely to work, and truly addressing the problem may require a combination of public investment in data to train medical AI and regulatory requirements for cross-context validation.  Nevertheless, if black-box medicine is to achieve its goal of bringing excellent medicine to broad sets of patients, the problem of contextual bias should be recognized and addressed sooner rather than later.},

While I agree with these criticisms, I argue that they only meaningfully call into question the “consent” part of notice-and-consent, and that they say little about the value of notice.

Our analyses show two interesting conclusions for this emerging application: the BFFs have a higher predictive value then the person’s friends and secondly, the interest-based data that define LALs, yield better results than the social network data. Moreover, the model built on interest data is not significantly worse than the model that uses all available data, hence demonstrating the potential of Facebook data in a microfinance setting.},

I argue, however, that opaque decisions are more common in medicine than critics realize. Moreover, as Aristotle noted over two millennia ago, when our knowledge of causal systems is incomplete and precarious—as it often is in medicine—the ability to explain how results are produced can be less important than the ability to produce such results and empirically verify their accuracy.},

	abstract = {PurposeTo prospectively determine the interpretation time associated with computer-aided detection (CAD) and to analyze how CAD affected radiologists’ decisions and their level of confidence in their interpretations of digital screening mammograms.Materials and MethodsAn Institutional Review Board exemption was obtained, and patient consent was waived in this HIPAA compliant study. The participating radiologists gave informed consent. Five radiologists were prospectively studied as they interpreted 267 clinical digital screening mammograms. Interpretation times, recall decisions, and confidence levels were recorded without CAD and then with CAD. Software was used for linear regression fitting of interpretation times. P values less than .05 were considered to indicate statistically significant differences.ResultsMean interpretation time without CAD was 118 seconds ± 4.2 (standard error of the mean). Mean time for reviewing CAD images was 23 seconds ± 1.5. CAD identified additional findings in five cases, increased confidence in 38 cases, and decreased confidence in 21 cases. Interpretation time without CAD increased with the number of mammographic views (P {\textless} .0001). Mean times for interpretation without CAD and review of the CAD images both increased with the number of CAD marks (P {\textless} .0001). The interpreting radiologist was a significant variable for all interpretation times (P {\textless} .0001). Interpretation time with CAD increased by 3.2 seconds (95\% confidence interval: 1.8, 4.6) for each calcification cluster marked and by 7.3 seconds (95\% confidence interval: 4.7, 9.9) for each mass marked.ConclusionThe additional time required to review CAD images represented a 19\% increase in the mean interpretation time without CAD. CAD requires a considerable time investment for digital screening mammography but may provide less measureable benefits in terms of confidence of the radiologists.© RSNA, 2010},

	abstract = {Translating machine learning (ML) models effectively to clinical practice requires establishing clinicians' trust. Explainability, or the ability of an ML model to justify its outcomes and assist clinicians in rationalizing the model prediction, has been generally understood to be critical to establishing trust. However, the field suffers from the lack of concrete definitions for usable explanations in different settings. To identify specific aspects of explainability that may catalyze building trust in ML models, we surveyed clinicians from two distinct acute care specialties (Intenstive Care Unit and Emergency Department). We use their feedback to characterize when explainability helps to improve clinicians' trust in ML models. We further identify the classes of explanations that clinicians identified as most relevant and crucial for effective translation to clinical practice. Finally, we discern concrete metrics for rigorous evaluation of clinical explainability methods. By integrating perceptions of explainability between clinicians and ML researchers we hope to facilitate the endorsement and broader adoption and sustained use of ML systems in healthcare.},

Indeed, European law provides individuals limited rights to 'meaningful information about the logic' behind significant, autonomous decisions such as loan approvals, insurance quotes, and CV filtering. We undertake three experimental studies examining people's perceptions of justice in algorithmic decision-making under different scenarios and explanation styles. Dimensions of justice previously observed in response to human decision-making appear similarly engaged in response to algorithmic decisions. Qualitative analysis identified several concerns and heuristics involved in justice perceptions including arbitrariness, generalisation, and (in)dignity. Quantitative analysis indicates that explanation styles primarily matter to justice perceptions only when subjects are exposed to multiple different styles---under repeated exposure of one style, scenario effects obscure any explanation effects. Our results suggests there may be no 'best' approach to explaining algorithmic decisions, and that reflection on their automated nature both implicates and mitigates justice dimensions.},

In this paper we argue that the frameworks through which the discontents of optimization systems have been approached so far cover a narrow subset of these problems by (i) assuming that the system provider has the incentives and means to mitigate the imbalances optimization causes, (ii) disregarding problems that go beyond discrimination due to disparate treatment or impact in algorithmic decision making, and (iii) developing solutions focused on removing algorithmic biases related to discrimination. In response we introduce Protective Optimization Technologies: solutions that enable optimization subjects to defend from unwanted consequences. We provide a framework that formalizes the design space of POTs and show how it differs from other design paradigms in the literature. We show how the framework can capture strategies developed in the wild against real optimization systems, and how it can be used to design, implement, and evaluate a POT that enables individuals and collectives to protect themselves from unbalances in a credit scoring application related to loan allocation.},

Traditional computer-aided detection (CAD) for mammography decision-support could not reach the level of an independent reader. Deep learning (DL) outperforms CAD and is close to surpassing human performance. DL is already capable of decision support and density assessment for 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM), and is on the cusp of providing consistent, accurate and interpretable mammography reading as an independent reader.SummaryA bold vision for the future of breast cancer screening is required if programmes are to maintain double reading standards. DL provides the potential for single reading programmes, such as in the USA, to reach EU double reading accuracy, as well as providing practical support for adoption of the emerging modality of digital breast tomosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Most practical recommender systems focus on estimating immediate user engagement without considering the long-term effects of recommendations on user behavior. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods offer the potential to optimize recommendations for long-term user engagement. However, since users are often presented with slates of multiple items - which may have interacting effects on user choice - methods are required to deal with the combinatorics of the RL action space. In this work, we address the challenge of making slate-based recommendations to optimize long-term value using RL. Our contributions are three-fold. (i) We develop SLATEQ, a decomposition of value-based temporal-difference and Q-learning that renders RL tractable with slates. Under mild assumptions on user choice behavior, we show that the long-term value (LTV) of a slate can be decomposed into a tractable function of its component item-wise LTVs. (ii) We outline a methodology that leverages existing myopic learning-based recommenders to quickly develop a recommender that handles LTV. (iii) We demonstrate our methods in simulation, and validate the scalability of decomposed TD-learning using SLATEQ in live experiments on YouTube.},

Various types of data have been emerging in modern biomedical research, including electronic health records, imaging, -omics, sensor data and text, which are complex, heterogeneous, poorly annotated and generally unstructured. Traditional data mining and statistical learning approaches typically need to ﬁrst perform feature engineering to obtain effective and more robust features from those data, and then build prediction or clustering models on top of them. There are lots of challenges on both steps in a scenario of complicated data and lacking of sufﬁcient domain knowledge. The latest advances in deep learning technologies provide new effective paradigms to obtain end-toend learning models from complex data. In this article, we review the recent literature on applying deep learning technologies to advance the health care domain. Based on the analyzed work, we suggest that deep learning approaches could be the vehicle for translating big biomedical data into improved human health. However, we also note limitations and needs for improved methods development and applications, especially in terms of ease-of-understanding for domain experts and citizen scientists. We discuss such challenges and suggest developing holistic and meaningful interpretable architectures to bridge deep learning models and human interpretability.},

	abstract = {Among all physiological signals, electrocardiogram (ECG) has seen some of the largest expansion in both medical and recreational applications with the rise of single-lead versions. These versions are embedded in medical devices and wearable products such as the injectable Medtronic Linq monitor, the iRhythm Ziopatch wearable monitor, and the Apple Watch Series 4. Recently, deep neural networks have been used to classify ECGs, outperforming even physicians specialized in cardiac electrophysiology. However, deep learning classifiers have been shown to be brittle to adversarial examples, including in medical-related tasks. Yet, traditional attack methods such as projected gradient descent (PGD) create examples that introduce square wave artifacts that are not physiological. Here, we develop a method to construct smoothed adversarial examples. We chose to focus on models learned on the data from the 2017 PhysioNet/Computing-in-Cardiology Challenge for single lead ECG classification. For this model, we utilized a new technique to generate smoothed examples to produce signals that are 1) indistinguishable to cardiologists from the original examples 2) incorrectly classified by the neural network. Further, we show that adversarial examples are not rare. Deep neural networks that have achieved state-of-the-art performance fail to classify smoothed adversarial ECGs that look real to clinical experts.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-020454-9},
	shorttitle = {The {Ethics} of {Surgery}},
	abstract = {According to popular belief, technical skill is far more important for surgeons than thoughtful deliberation. Nothing could be further from the truth. Although surgeons must sometimes make decisions rapidly on the basis of incomplete evidence and must respond to unexpected catastrophes in the operating room rapidly, those events are intermittent - most of the time surgeons deliberate on diagnostic problems and thoughtfully manage postoperative care, which is often intellectually challenging. The relationship of surgeons with their patients is, in a real sense, far more intimate and trusting than that of any other professional, a claim that is supported by the fact that patients surrender their bodies to their surgeons in a state of total helplessness and vulnerability when they undergo anesthesia. Because of that responsibility, no other professional group has a greater sense of dedication to the welfare of their patients than surgeons. Surgical culture is deeply steeped in ethics, and surgeons confront and resolve ethical dilemmas as much or more than most other professionals, although they often may not recognize the situations they resolve are problems in ethics - they are just part of the daily routine. This book is a compendium of articles from the recent surgical literature that address ethical issues chosen by surgeons because they are controversial and pertinent to the practice of surgery. The reader will not find a great deal of sophisticated dissection of fine philosophical distinctions in these discussions of ethical conflicts and controversies in surgery. Instead, they will discover differing viewpoints from thoughtful essayists, mostly surgeons, whose feet are firmly in contact with the ground and who have extensive experience in the real world of surgery, medicine, and law.},

We specifically consider adversarial examples with longitudinal EHR data, an area that has not been previously examined because of the challenges with temporal high-dimensional and sparse features. We propose Longitudinal AdVersarial Attack (, a saliency score based adversarial example using a method that requires a minimal number of perturbations and that automatically minimizes the likelihood of detection. Features are selected and modified by jointly modeling a saliency map and attention mechanism. Experimental results with longitudinal EHR data show that an substantially reduce model performance for attention-based target models (from AUPR = 0.5 to AUPR = 0.08).},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) methods have demonstrated impressive performance in many application fields such as autopilot, facial recognition, and spam detection. Traditionally, ML models are trained and deployed in a benign setting, in which the testing and training data have identical statistical characteristics. However, this assumption usually does not hold in the sense that the ML model is designed in an adversarial setting, where some statistical properties of the data can be tampered with by a capable adversary. Specifically, it has been observed that adversarial examples (also known as adversarial input perambulations) elaborately crafted during training/test phases can seriously undermine the ML performance. The susceptibility of ML models in adversarial settings and the corresponding countermeasures have been studied by many researchers in both academic and industrial communities. In this work, we present a comprehensive overview of the investigation of the security properties of ML algorithms under adversarial settings. First, we analyze the ML security model to develop a blueprint for this interdisciplinary research area. Then, we review adversarial attack methods and discuss the defense strategies against them. Finally, relying upon the reviewed work, we provide prospective relevant future works for designing more secure ML models.},

In this paper, we extensively analyzed the performance of two state-of-the-art classification deep networks on chest X-ray images. These two networks were attacked by three different categories (ten methods in total) of adversarial methods (both white- and black-box), namely gradient-based, score-based, and decision-based attacks. Furthermore, we modified the pooling operations in the two classification networks to measure their sensitivities against different attacks, on the specific task of chest X-ray classification.},

The goal of this proposal is to enable better communication between dataset creators and users, and help the AI community move toward greater transparency and accountability. By analogy, in computer hardware, it has become industry standard to accompany everything from the simplest components (e.g., resistors), to the most complex microprocessor chips, with datasheets detailing standard operating characteristics, test results, recommended usage, and other information. We outline some of the questions a datasheet for datasets should answer. These questions focus on when, where, and how the training data was gathered, its recommended use cases, and, in the case of human-centric datasets, information regarding the subjects' demographics and consent as applicable. We develop prototypes of datasheets for two well-known datasets: Labeled Faces in The Wild and the Pang {\textbackslash}\& Lee Polarity Dataset.},

Moreover, they need to serve billions of users, who are unique at any point in time, making a complex user state space. Luckily, huge quantities of logged implicit feedback (e.g., user clicks, dwell time) are available for learning. Learning from the logged feedback is however subject to biases caused by only observing feedback on recommendations selected by the previous versions of the recommender. In this work, we present a general recipe of addressing such biases in a production top-K recommender system at Youtube, built with a policy-gradient-based algorithm, i.e. REINFORCE. The contributions of the paper are: (1) scaling REINFORCE to a production recommender system with an action space on the orders of millions; (2) applying off-policy correction to address data biases in learning from logged feedback collected from multiple behavior policies; (3) proposing a novel top-K off-policy correction to account for our policy recommending multiple items at a time; (4) showcasing the value of exploration.

Significant research has focused on how time, location, interfaces, and a plethora of other contextual features affect recommendations. However, in using deep neural networks for recommender systems, researchers often ignore these contexts or incorporate them as ordinary features in the model. In this paper, we study how to effectively treat contextual data in neural recommender systems. We begin with an empirical analysis of the conventional approach to context as features in feed-forward recommenders and demonstrate that this approach is inefficient in capturing common feature crosses. We apply this insight to design a state-of-the-art RNN recommender system. We first describe our RNN-based recommender system in use at YouTube. Next, we offer "Latent Cross," an easy-to-use technique to incorporate contextual data in the RNN by embedding the context feature first and then performing an element-wise product of the context embedding with model's hidden states. We demonstrate the improvement in performance by using this Latent Cross technique in multiple experimental settings.},

As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP.

	abstract = {Critical to successful human interaction is a capacity for empathy - the ability to understand and share the thoughts and feelings of another. As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly required to interact with humans in a myriad of settings, it is important to enable AI to wield empathy as a tool to benefit those it interacts with. In this paper, we work towards this goal by bringing together a number of important concepts: empathy, AI planning, and reasoning in the presence of knowledge and belief. We formalize the notion of Empathetic Planning which is informed by the beliefs and affective state of the empathizee. We appeal to an epistemic logic framework to represent the beliefs of the empathizee and propose AI planning-based computational approaches to compute empathetic solutions. We illustrate the potential benefits of our approach by conducting a study where we evaluate participants' perceptions of the agent's empathetic abilities and assistive capabilities.},

	abstract = {Revenue management can enable airline corporations to maximize the revenue generated from each scheduled flight departing in their transportation network by means of finding the optimal policies for differential pricing, seat inventory control and overbooking. As different demand segments in the market have different Willingness-To-Pay (WTP), airlines use differential pricing, booking restrictions, and service amenities to determine different fare classes or products targeted at each of these demand segments. Because seats are limited for each flight, airlines also need to allocate seats for each of these fare classes to prevent lower fare class passengers from displacing higher fare class ones and set overbooking limits in anticipation of cancellations and no-shows such that revenue is maximized. Previous work addresses these problems using optimization techniques or classical Reinforcement Learning methods. This paper focuses on the latter problem - the seat inventory control problem - casting it as a Markov Decision Process to be able to find the optimal policy. Multiple fare classes, concurrent continuous arrival of passengers of different fare classes, overbooking and random cancellations that are independent of class have been considered in the model. We have addressed this problem using Deep Q-Learning with the goal of maximizing the reward for each flight departure. The implementation of this technique allows us to employ large continuous state space but also presents the potential opportunity to test on real time airline data. To generate data and train the agent, a basic air-travel market simulator was developed. The performance of the agent in different simulated market scenarios was compared against theoretically optimal solutions and was found to be nearly close to the expected optimal revenue.},

Interestingly, other types of so far unreported moderate biases in word embedding models have been identified. Specifically, biases against intellectual phenomena such as political and religious orientation. The mismatch between the results reported here and the dominant themes in the relevant literature might be due to another type of bias entrenched within the algorithmic fairness epistemic community and that manifests itself as a predilection for exploring primordially only certain regions of the research landscape.},

In this paper, we identify a surprising consequence of popularity-based rankings: the fewer the items reporting a given signal, the higher the share of the overall traffic they collectively attract. This few-get-richer effect emerges in settings where there are few distinct classes of items (e.g., left-leaning news sources versus right-leaning news sources), and items are ranked based on their popularity. We demonstrate analytically that the few-get-richer effect emerges when people tend to click on top-ranked items and have heterogeneous preferences for the classes of items. Using simulations, we analyze how the strength of the effect changes with assumptions about the setting and human behavior. We also test our predictions experimentally in an online experiment with human participants. Our findings have important implications to understand the spread of misinformation.},

Methods or processes that have the potential to precisely focus investigative resources will advance operational excellence and improve investigative capabilities. Facial expressions have the ability to communicate emotion and regulate interpersonal behavior. Over the past 30 years, scientists have developed human-observer based methods that can be used to classify and correlate facial expressions with human emotion. However, these methods have proven to be labor intensive, qualitative, and difficult to standardize. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) developed by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen is the most widely used and validated method for measuring and describing facial behaviors. The Automated Facial Expression Recognition System (AFERS) automates the manual practice of FACS, leveraging the research and technology behind the CMU/PITT Automated Facial Image Analysis System (AFA) system developed by Dr. Jeffery Cohn and his colleagues at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. This portable, near real-time system will detect the seven universal expressions of emotion (figure 1), providing investigators with indicators of the presence of deception during the interview process. In addition, the system will include features such as full video support, snapshot generation, and case management utilities, enabling users to re-evaluate interviews in detail at a later date.},

We also investigate how the accuracy of social network based scores changes when individuals can strategically construct their social networks to attain higher credit scores. We  find that, if individuals are motivated to improve their scores, they may form fewer ties and focus them on more similar partners. The impact of such endogenous tie formation on the accuracy of consumer credit scores is ambiguous. Scores can become more accurate as a result of modi fications in social networks, but this accuracy improvement may come with greater network fragmentation. The threat of social exclusion in such endogenously formed networks provides incentives to low type members to exert e ffort that improves everyone's creditworthiness.

It first focuses on the politics of technology and algorithmic surveillance systems in particular: considering t he broad politics of technology; the nature of algorithmic surveillance and biometrics, claiming that software algorithms are a particularly important domain of techno-politics; and finally considering both the growth of algorithmic biometric surveillance and the potential problems with such systems. Secondly, it gives an account of FRS’s, the algorithms upon which they are based, and the biases embedded therein. In the third part, the ways in which these biases may manifest itself in real world implementation of FRS’s are outlined. Finally, some policy suggestions for the future development of FRS’s are made; it is noted that the most common critiques of such systems are based on notions of privacy which seem increasingly at odds with the world of automated systems. Introduction: the circulation of faces In a post 9/11 world security has become a big question for those feeling vulnerable. As in so many instances in social history the answer to this vulnerability is sought in a sort of certainty rooted in surveillance (Lyon, 1994, 2001, 2002; Dandeker, 1990). It is argued that through surveillance and early detection the problem can be solved. Security can be secured. Surveillance is a powerful technology for social control, however, when surveillance becomes digitised then a there is a “step change in power, intensity and scope” (Graham and Wood, 2003). Digitisation permits the use of software algorithms (mathematical instructions –see Section 2) for automated identification of human biometrics (a bodily trace see Section 2) With a biometric it is very difficult, if not impossible, for any individual to disassociate oneself (or 1 Centre for the Study of Technology and Organisation, Lancaster University Management School, mailto:l.introna@lancaster.ac.uk 2 Global Urban Research Unit (GURU), School of Architecture Planning and Landscape, University of Newcastle. mailto:d.f.j.wood@ncl.ac.uk Introna and Wood: Picturing Algorithmic Surveillance Surveillance \& Society 2(2/3) 178 be alienated) from one’s biometric – in a sense you are your biometric (Van der Ploeg, 2002). Thus, if there is a match between your body and your biometric certainty over identity can be established. However effective surveillance also needs to be subtle, to be insinuated into the context of everyday life. Indeed in the security world the perfect unobtrusive biometric is considered the ‘holy grail’. It is therefore not surprising that facial recognition system (FRS) have become a prime focus for the security establishment (Kopel \& Krause, 2003). Not only are they relatively inexpensive, and supposedly effective, they require no involvement from their targets. Unlike other biometrics facial recognition can operate anonymously in the background. The targets do not need to surrender their face image, as they would their fingerprint, or their iris scan. A face can be captured and (de)coded without the consent or participation from those being targeted. However, this ‘captured’ face image is only of use if it can be matched with an identifier. It requires a database of face images with associated identities. Unlike fingerprints or DNA samples, which are only collected when there is a reasonable level of suspicion of a crime, face images are routinely collected in society by a variety of institutions, such as when we apply for a driving licence, or a passport, or a library card, etc. It is the most common biometric in use by humans to identify other humans. Indeed, in any western society, if one would somehow cover, or be seen to attempt to disguise one’s face, then there is almost an immediate assumption of guilt. One could almost say that there is an implicit common agreement to reveal our faces to others as a condition for ongoing social order. Thus, we tend to reveal our face to others and they to us. However, it seems that such an agreement only operates in a local and situated manner, as part of the social relationships we control. We would find it unacceptable if a stranger would photograph our face for no apparent reason. On the other hand we don’t find it unacceptable to surrender our faces for the regulation of privileges—as long as we are in control of its use and circulation. In most cases it is used in the moment of authentication (by means of visual comparison) and then forgotten. However, what happens if our faces are collected anonymously, encoded, and start to circulate in an invisible network, even if it is for seemingly mundane reasons? When our face “becomes a bar code”, in the words of Agre (2003). This seems not what we have in mind when we reveal our faces? It seems to us that the presence of FRS’s may indeed be changing the implied relationships we assume when facing others. This concern becomes even more acute if we start to ‘unpack’ these algorithms to discover that to the algorithms ‘all faces are not equal’. It is our contention that FRS’s is a very powerful and ambiguous technology for social control. As such it requires much more scrutiny than it has had up to now. The purpose of this paper is to open up for scrutiny the politics of facial recognition technology and its use in ‘smart’ CCTV. We aim to show that seemingly mundane design decisions may have important political consequences that ought to be subject to scrutiny. This paper is one step in that direction. It is structured as follows: the first section will focus on the politics of technology and algorithmic surveillance systems in particular, considering first the broad politics of technology, then explaining the nature of algorithmic surveillance and biometrics, claiming that software algorithms are a particularly important domain of technopolitics; and finally considering both the growth of algorithmic biometric surveillance and the Introna and Wood: Picturing Algorithmic Surveillance Surveillance \& Society 2(2/3) 179 potential problems with such systems. In the second section, we will give an account of FRS’s, the algorithms they are based upon, and the biases embedded therein. In the third part, we will discuss the ways in which these biases may manifest itself in real world implementation of FRS’s. Finally, we will make some policy suggestion for the future development of FRS’s; it should be noted that the most common critiques of such systems are based on notions of privacy which seem increasingly at odds with the world of automated systems. 1. The Politics of Technology The Micro-Politics of the Artefact Technology is political (Winner, 1980). By this we mean that technology, by its very design, includes certain interests and excludes others. It is mostly an implicit politics, part of a mundane process of trying to solve practical problems. For example the ATM bank machine assumes a particular person in front of it. It assumes a person that is able to see the screen, read it, remember and enter a PIN code, etc. It is not difficult to imagine a whole section of society that does not conform with this assumption. If you are blind, in a wheelchair, have problem remembering, or unable to enter a PIN, because of disability, then your interest in accessing your account can be excluded by the ATM design. This exclusion of interests may not be obvious to the designers of ATMs as they may see their task as trying simply to solve a basic problem of making banking transactions more efficient for the ‘average’ customer doing average transactions. And they are mostly right — but if they are not, then their biases can become profoundly stubborn. These systems often seem like devices for surveillance and social control (in the sense of Foucault’s dispositif panoptique), but as Lianos (2001, 2003) has recently pointed out, they are not designed with the monitoring and control of the human subject directly in mind, rather this is a potential (or secondary) function of systems for ensuring flow. Nevertheless the binary effects are in some senses quite irreversible. Where does the excluded go to appeal when they are faced with a stubborn and mute object such as an ATM? Maybe they can work around it, by going into the branch for example. This may be possible. However, this exclusion becomes all the more significant because of the political economic context in which these dispositifs exists and which they help to transform, for example if banks start to close branches or charge for an over-the-counter transaction (as is happening). Thus, as the micropolitics of the ATM becomes tied to, and multiplied through other exclusionary practices, what seems to be a rather trivial injustice soon may multiply into what may seem to be as an coherent and intentional strategy of exclusion (Introna and Nissenbaum, 2000). Yet there is often nobody there that ‘authored’ it as such (Foucault, 1975; Kafka, 1925). This paper will show how such an ‘unauthored’ strategy may be emerging in facial recognition technology. Thus, the politics of technology is more than the politics of this or that artefact. Rather these artefacts function as nodes, or links, in a dynamic socio-technical network, or collective, kept in place by a multiplicity of artefacts, agreements, alliances, conventions, translations, procedures, threats, and so forth: in short by relationships of power and discipline (Callon 1986, 1991). Some are stable, even irreversible; some are dynamic and fragile. Analytically we can isolate and describe these networks (see Law 1991, for examples). However, as we survey the landscape of networks we cannot locate, in any obvious manner, where they begin nor where Introna and Wood: Picturing Algori},

Central to the ideas aimed at curbing this trend is the use of technology in the form of the mandate to implement electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs consist of patient information such as demographics, medications, laboratory test results, diagnosis codes, and procedures. Mining EHRs could lead to improvement in patient health management as EHRs contain detailed information related to disease prognosis for large patient populations. In this article, we provide a structured and comprehensive overview of data mining techniques for modeling EHRs. We first provide a detailed understanding of the major application areas to which EHR mining has been applied and then discuss the nature of EHR data and its accompanying challenges. Next, we describe major approaches used for EHR mining, the metrics associated with EHRs, and the various study designs. With this foundation, we then provide a systematic and methodological organization of existing data mining techniques used to model EHRs and discuss ideas for future research.},

Performance disparities in these algorithms could translate into disparate impact in the form of biased accident outcomes. To evaluate the need for such concerns, we characterize the age and gender bias in the performance of state-of-the-art pedestrian detection algorithms. Our analysis is based on the INRIA Person Dataset extended with child, adult, male and female labels. We show that all of the 24 top-performing methods of the Caltech Pedestrian Detection Benchmark have higher miss rates on children. The difference is significant and we analyse how it varies with the classifier, features and training data used by the methods. Algorithms were also gender-biased on average but the performance differences were not significant. We discuss the source of the bias, the ethical implications, possible technical solutions and barriers.},

Yet, to date, little is known about how these methods are being used in practice. How are algorithmic assessments built, validated, and examined for bias? In this work, we document and assess the claims and practices of companies offering algorithms for employment assessment, using a methodology that can be applied to evaluate similar applications and issues of bias in other domains. In particular, we identify vendors of algorithmic pre-employment assessments (i.e., algorithms to screen candidates), document what they have disclosed about their development and validation procedures, and evaluate their techniques for detecting and mitigating bias. We find that companies' formulation of "bias" varies, as do their approaches to dealing with it. We also discuss the various choices vendors make regarding data collection and prediction targets, in light of the risks and trade-offs that these choices pose. We consider the implications of these choices and we raise a number of technical and legal considerations.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07892},
	abstract = {The ethical implications and social impacts of artificial intelligence have become topics of compelling interest to industry, researchers in academia, and the public. However, current analyses of AI in a global context are biased toward perspectives held in the U.S., and limited by a lack of research, especially outside the U.S. and Western Europe. This article summarizes the key findings of a literature review of recent social science scholarship on the social impacts of AI and related technologies in five global regions. Our team of social science researchers reviewed more than 800 academic journal articles and monographs in over a dozen languages. Our review of the literature suggests that AI is likely to have markedly different social impacts depending on geographical setting. Likewise, perceptions and understandings of AI are likely to be profoundly shaped by local cultural and social context. Recent research in U.S. settings demonstrates that AI-driven technologies have a pattern of entrenching social divides and exacerbating social inequality, particularly among historically-marginalized groups. Our literature review indicates that this pattern exists on a global scale, and suggests that low- and middle-income countries may be more vulnerable to the negative social impacts of AI and less likely to benefit from the attendant gains. We call for rigorous ethnographic research to better understand the social impacts of AI around the world. Global, on-the-ground research is particularly critical to identify AI systems that may amplify social inequality in order to mitigate potential harms. Deeper understanding of the social impacts of AI in diverse social settings is a necessary precursor to the development, implementation, and monitoring of responsible and beneficial AI technologies, and forms the basis for meaningful regulation of these technologies.},

	abstract = {Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) has become increasingly important in many applications, such as autonomous cars and medical diagnosis, where explanations are preferred to help people better understand how machine learning systems work and further enhance their trust towards systems. Particularly in robotics, explanations from IML are significantly helpful in providing reasons for those adverse and inscrutable actions, which could impair the safety and profit of the public. However, due to the diversified scenarios and subjective nature of explanations, we rarely have the ground truth for benchmark evaluation in IML on the quality of generated explanations. Having a sense of explanation quality not only matters for quantifying system boundaries, but also helps to realize the true benefits to human users in real-world applications. To benchmark evaluation in IML, in this paper, we rigorously define the problem of evaluating explanations, and systematically review the existing efforts. Specifically, we summarize three general aspects of explanation (i.e., predictability, fidelity and persuasibility) with formal definitions, and respectively review the representative methodologies for each of them under different tasks. Further, a unified evaluation framework is designed according to the hierarchical needs from developers and end-users, which could be easily adopted for different scenarios in practice. In the end, open problems are discussed, and several limitations of current evaluation techniques are raised for future explorations.},

In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classiﬁcation system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We ﬁnd that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6\% for IJB-A and 86.2\% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classiﬁcation systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassiﬁed group (with error rates of up to 34.7\%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8\%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classiﬁcation systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

	abstract = {Deep learning applies multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of feature extraction. This emerging technique has reshaped the research landscape of face recognition since 2014, launched by the breakthroughs of Deepface and DeepID methods. Since then, deep face recognition (FR) technique, which leverages the hierarchical architecture to learn discriminative face representation, has dramatically improved the state-of-the-art performance and fostered numerous successful real-world applications. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the recent developments on deep FR, covering the broad topics on algorithms, data, and scenes. First, we summarize different network architectures and loss functions proposed in the rapid evolution of the deep FR methods. Second, the related face processing methods are categorized into two classes: `one-to-many augmentation' and `many-to-one normalization'. Then, we summarize and compare the commonly used databases for both model training and evaluation. Third, we review miscellaneous scenes in deep FR, such as cross-factor, heterogenous, multiple-media and industry scenes. Finally, potential deficiencies of the current methods and several future directions are highlighted.},

Results show that the tools are generally proficient at determining gender, with accuracy rates greater than 90\%, except for IBM Bluemix. Concerning race, only one of the four tools provides this capability, Face++, with an accuracy rate of greater than 90\%, although the evaluation was performed on a high-quality dataset. Inferring age appears to be a challenging problem, as all four tools performed poorly. The findings of our quantitative evaluation are helpful for future computational social science research using these tools, as their accuracy needs to be taken into account when applied to classifying individuals on social media and other contexts. Triangulation and manual verification are suggested for researchers employing these tools.},

	abstract = {According to the theory of contextual integrity (CI), privacy norms prescribe information flows with reference to five parameters — sender, recipient, subject, information type, and transmission principle. Because privacy is grasped contextually (e.g., health, education, civic life, etc.), the values of these parameters range over contextually meaningful ontologies — of information types (or topics) and actors (subjects, senders, and recipients), in contextually defined capacities. As an alternative to predominant approaches to privacy, which were ineffective against novel information practices enabled by IT, CI was able both to pinpoint sources of disruption and provide grounds for either accepting or rejecting them. Mounting challenges from a burgeoning array of networked, sensor-enabled devices (IoT) and data-ravenous machine learning systems, similar in form though magnified in scope, call for renewed attention to theory. This Article introduces the metaphor of a data (food) chain to capture the nature of these challenges. With motion up the chain, where data of higher order is inferred from lower-order data, the crucial question is whether privacy norms governing lower-order data are sufficient for the inferred higher-order data. While CI has a response to this question, a greater challenge comes from data primitives, such as digital impulses of mouse clicks, motion detectors, and bare GPS coordinates, because they appear to have no meaning. Absent a semantics, they escape CI’s privacy norms entirely.},

	abstract = {The mucopolysacharidoses (MPS) have a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Taking this into consideration and exploring the benefits of noninvasive phenotypic characterization using frontal pictures, we decided to test if a tool for facial recognition could properly identify patients with MPS III and IV. The FDNA Face2Gene algorithm extracts mathematical facial descriptors from patient’s frontal pictures and compares them with syndrome gestalts in order to suggest potential diagnoses. We tested the version 18.1.14 of the algorithm with pictures from 25 known MPS patients (MPS IIIB=16, MPS IVA=9). For each patient, a de-identified case was created with frontal pictures, date of birth, height, weight and head circumference, and the phenotype was refined with the following descriptors: coarse facial features, hepatomegaly, short stature, intellectual disability, psychomotor deterioration, abnormal heart valve morphology, cardiomyopathy, hernia, hearing impairment, kyphosis, splenomegaly, genu valgum, corneal opacity, dysostosis multiplex, respiratory distress and pectus carinatum, according to the clinical examination. The Face2gene scores were classified as low, medium and high similarity. For the scores, 1 (4\%) did not receive an MPS score, 9 patients (36\%) had the lowest, 14 (56\%) medium, and 1 (4\%) the highest score. For the MPS IIIB patients, 15 (94\%) had MPS as suggested diagnosis within the top 5 syndromes. Furthermore, 10 (62\%) had MPS IIIB as one of the top 5 suggested diagnosis. For the MPS IVA patients, all had MPS as suggested diagnosis however none had MPS IV suggested. Other than MPS, the most common suggested diagnoses were: Angelman, DiGeorge, and Williams-Beuren syndrome. In conclusion, the algorithm was able to properly suggest MPS as a possible diagnosis in most patients based only on frontal images with minimal clinical data and without any tests, nonetheless improvements are still necessary. This approach could be valuable in lower-income countries where access to diagnosis is limited.},

	abstract = {The salient facial feature discovery is one of the important research tasks in ethnical group face recognition. In this paper, we first construct an ethnical group face dataset including Chinese Uyghur, Tibetan, and Korean. Then, we show that the effective sparse sensing approach to general face recognition is not working anymore for ethnical group facial recognition if the features based on whole face image are used. This is partially due to a fact that each ethnical group may have its own characteristics manifesting only in specified face regions. Therefore, we will analyze the particularity of three ethnical groups and aim to find the common characterizations in some local regions for the three ethnical groups. For this purpose, we first use the facial landmark detector STASM to find some important landmarks in a face image, then, we use the well-known data mining technique, the mRMR algorithm, to select the salient geometric length features based on all possible lines connected by any two landmarks. Second, based on these selected salient features, we construct three ?T? regions in a face image for ethnical feature representation and prove them to be effective areas for ethnicity recognition. Finally, some extensive experiments are conducted and the results reveal that the proposed ?T? regions with extracted features are quite effective for ethnical group facial recognition when the L2-norm is adopted using the sparse sensing approach. In comparison to face recognition, the proposed three ?T? regions are evaluated on the olivetti research laboratory face dataset, and the results show that the constructed ?T? regions for ethnicity recognition are not suitable for general face recognition.

These parameters include such variables as position, pose, lighting, background, camera quality, and gender. While there are many applications for face recognition technology in which one can control the parameters of image acquisition, there are also many applications in which the practitioner has little or no control over such parameters. This database, Labeled Faces in the Wild, is provided as an aid in studying the latter, unconstrained, recognition problem. The database contains labeled face photographs spanning the range of conditions typically encountered in everyday life. The database exhibits “natural” variability in factors such as pose, lighting, race, accessories, occlusions, and background. In addition to describing the details of the database, we provide specific experimental paradigms for which the database is suitable. This is done in an effort to make research performed with the database as consistent and comparable as possible. We provide baseline results, including results of a state of the art face recognition system combined with a face alignment system. To facilitate experimentation on the database, we provide several parallel databases, including an aligned version.},

	abstract = {Despite significant recent advances in the field of face recognition, implementing face verification and recognition efficiently at scale presents serious challenges to current approaches. In this paper we present a system, called FaceNet, that directly learns a mapping from face images to a compact Euclidean space where distances directly correspond to a measure of face similarity. Once this space has been produced, tasks such as face recognition, verification and clustering can be easily implemented using standard techniques with FaceNet embeddings as feature vectors. Our method uses a deep convolutional network trained to directly optimize the embedding itself, rather than an intermediate bottleneck layer as in previous deep learning approaches. To train, we use triplets of roughly aligned matching / non-matching face patches generated using a novel online triplet mining method. The benefit of our approach is much greater representational efficiency: we achieve state-of-the-art face recognition performance using only 128-bytes per face. On the widely used Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, our system achieves a new record accuracy of 99.63\%. On YouTube Faces DB it achieves 95.12\%. Our system cuts the error rate in comparison to the best published result by 30\% on both datasets. We also introduce the concept of harmonic embeddings, and a harmonic triplet loss, which describe different versions of face embeddings (produced by different networks) that are compatible to each other and allow for direct comparison between each other.},

We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classiﬁcation task.

	abstract = {With public and academic attention increasingly focused on the new role of machine learning in the health information economy, an unusual and no-longer-esoteric category of vulnerabilities in machine-learning systems could prove important. These vulnerabilities allow a small, carefully designed change in how inputs are presented to a system to completely alter its output, causing it to confidently arrive at manifestly wrong conclusions. These advanced techniques to subvert otherwise-reliable machine-learning systems—so-called adversarial attacks—have, to date, been of interest primarily to computer science researchers (1). However, the landscape of often-competing interests within health care, and billions of dollars at stake in systems' outputs, implies considerable problems. We outline motivations that various players in the health care system may have to use adversarial attacks and begin a discussion of what to do about them. Far from discouraging continued innovation with medical machine learning, we call for active engagement of medical, technical, legal, and ethical experts in pursuit of efficient, broadly available, and effective health care that machine learning will enable.

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in various applications. However, recent studies show that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. DRL models have been attacked by adding perturbations to observations. While such observation based attack is only one aspect of potential attacks on DRL, other forms of attacks which are more practical require further analysis, such as manipulating environment dynamics. Therefore, we propose to understand the vulnerabilities of DRL from various perspectives and provide a thorough taxonomy of potential attacks. We conduct the first set of experiments on the unexplored parts within the taxonomy. In addition to current observation based attacks against DRL, we propose the first targeted attacks based on action space and environment dynamics. We also introduce the online sequential attacks based on temporal consistency information among frames. To better estimate gradient in black-box setting, we propose a sampling strategy and theoretically prove its efficiency and estimation error bound. We conduct extensive experiments to compare the effectiveness of different attacks with several baselines in various environments, including game playing, robotics control, and autonomous driving.},

	abstract = {Explainable Recommendation refers to the personalized recommendation algorithms that address the problem of why - they not only provide users with the recommendations, but also provide explanations to make the user or system designer aware of why such items are recommended. In this way, it helps to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, persuasiveness, and user satisfaction of recommendation systems. In recent years, a large number of explainable recommendation approaches -- especially model-based explainable recommendation algorithms -- have been proposed and adopted in real-world systems. In this survey, we review the work on explainable recommendation that has been published in or before the year of 2018. We first highlight the position of explainable recommendation in recommender system research by categorizing recommendation problems into the 5W, i.e., what, when, who, where, and why. We then conduct a comprehensive survey of explainable recommendation itself in terms of three aspects: 1) We provide a chronological research line of explanations in recommender systems, including the user study approaches in the early years, as well as the more recent model-based approaches. 2) We provide a taxonomy for explainable recommendation algorithms, including user-based, item-based, model-based, and post-model explanations. 3) We summarize the application of explainable recommendation in different recommendation tasks, including product recommendation, social recommendation, POI recommendation, etc. We devote a section to discuss the explanation perspectives in the broader IR and machine learning settings, as well as their relationship with explainable recommendation research. We end the survey by discussing potential future research directions to promote the explainable recommendation research area.},

However, while these claims may indeed capture some truth, they have also been massively oversold, or so we contend here. The goal of this paper is two-fold. First, we provide a qualified defence of the value of less data within the context of AI. This is done by carefully reviewing two distinct problems for big data driven AI, namely a) the limited track record of Deep Learning in key areas such as Natural Language Processing, b) the regulatory and business significance of being able to learn from few data points. Second, we briefly sketch what we refer to as a case of AI with humans and for humans, namely an AI paradigm whereby the systems we build are privacy-oriented and focused on human-machine collaboration, not competition. Combining our claims above, we conclude that when seen through the lens of cognitively inspired AI, the bright future of the discipline is about less data, not more, and more humans, not fewer.},

The second one distinguishes algorithmic biases on (1) prior information rearrangement and (2) posterior information arrangement. In all cases, we focus on and differentiate situations where algorithms empirically appear to expand the cognitive and social horizon of users, from those where they seem to limit that horizon.

	abstract = {The recent implementation of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) in France is part of a more general process of digitizing information flows, as the world enters the fourth industrial revolution in a phenomenon known as Industry 4.0. Behind this concept lies the concern to allow Man to remain permanently in control of his destiny, despite an increasingly interconnected world (Internet of Things, cooperative robots, augmented reality, etc.). Accordingly, the implementation of EHR must guarantee the respect for the private life of each citizen. From this perspective, healthcare professionals will therefore have to constantly ensure the protection of medical confidentiality during Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). This paper summarises the current state of the use of EHR in France. Based on a survey conducted by the European Commission to assess the deployment of digitalisation in the health sector in EU countries, this article aims to highlight the opportunities and perspectives that Industry 4.0 could bring to the health sector in France. However, this study also identifies a number of limits related to the application of such a system, the first of which is cyber threat or transhumanism. To this end, a SWOT matrix identifies the strengths and weaknesses related to the implementation of the French EHR.},

	abstract = {What would data science look like if its key critics were engaged to help improve it, and how might critiques of data science improve with an approach that considers the day-to-day practices of data science? This article argues for scholars to bridge the conversations that seek to critique data science and those that seek to advance data science practice to identify and create the social and organizational arrangements necessary for a more ethical data science. We summarize four critiques that are commonly made in critical data studies: data are inherently interpretive, data are inextricable from context, data are mediated through the sociomaterial arrangements that produce them, and data serve as a medium for the negotiation and communication of values. We present qualitative research with academic data scientists, “data for good” projects, and specialized cross-disciplinary engineering teams to show evidence of these critiques in the day-to-day experience of data scientists as they acknowledge and grapple with the complexities of their work. Using ethnographic vignettes from two large multiresearcher field sites, we develop a set of concepts for analyzing and advancing the practice of data science and improving critical data studies, including (1) communication is central to the data science endeavor; (2) making sense of data is a collective process; (3) data are starting, not end points, and (4) data are sets of stories. We conclude with two calls to action for researchers and practitioners in data science and critical data studies alike. First, creating opportunities for bringing social scientific and humanistic expertise into data science practice simultaneously will advance both data science and critical data studies. Second, practitioners should leverage the insights from critical data studies to build new kinds of organizational arrangements, which we argue will help advance a more ethical data science. Engaging the insights of critical data studies will improve data science. Careful attention to the practices of data science will improve scholarly critiques. Genuine collaborative conversations between these different communities will help push for more ethical, and better, ways of knowing in increasingly datum-saturated societies.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to assess the increasing challenges to governing the personal health information (PHI) essential for advancing artificial intelligence (AI) machine learning innovations in health care. Risks to privacy and justice/equity are discussed, along with potential solutions.,This conceptual paper highlights the scale and scope of PHI data consumed by deep learning algorithms and their opacity as novel challenges to health data governance.,This paper argues that these characteristics of machine learning will overwhelm existing data governance approaches such as privacy regulation and informed consent. Enhanced governance techniques and tools will be required to help preserve the autonomy and rights of individuals to control their PHI. Debate among all stakeholders and informed critique of how, and for whom, PHI-fueled health AI are developed and deployed are needed to channel these innovations in societally beneficial directions.,Health data may be used to address pressing societal concerns, such as operational and system-level improvement, and innovations such as personalized medicine. This paper informs work seeking to harness these resources for societal good amidst many competing value claims and substantial risks for privacy and security.,This is the first paper focusing on health data governance in relation to AI/machine learning.},
