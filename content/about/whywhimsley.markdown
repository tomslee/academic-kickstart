My book "No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart" needed a place to set some
stories, and that place needed a name. "Whimsley" was a mixture of
something whimsical and something down to earth, both of which those
stories are meant to be. The whimsical-whimsley part is obvious enough.
The "ley" is a reference to the many millstone grit towns of Yorkshire
-- Burley, Ilkley, Batley, Bramley, Barnsley and probably hundreds of
others, but particularly Otley. Also, there's the "sley --- slee"
similarity.

Once I'd used "Whimsley" in the book, it seemed like a natural name for
the place where I keep my writing.
