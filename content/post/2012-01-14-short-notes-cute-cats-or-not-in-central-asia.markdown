Doing some reading after up my recent post on Ethan Zuckerman's "Cute Cats" talk I came across [this](http://www.registan.net/index.php/2012/01/08/central-asia-an-exception-to-the-cute-cats-theory-of-internet-revolution/) post by Sarah Kendzior at registan.net. I know roughly nothing about the places and events she discusses, but it is a fascinating post by an obviously knowledgeable person, and the comments thread following it is one of the most absorbing I've ever read. Lots of people have great things to add, and they do so in a constructive and generous way.
