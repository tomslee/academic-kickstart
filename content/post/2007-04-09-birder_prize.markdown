For any birdwatchers (UK)/ birders (Cdn) out there, a certain [Dorset Dipper](http://dorsetdipper.blogspot.com/2007/04/rhodes-31-march-7-april.html) has a prize on offer of "Â£100 to the wildlife charity of your choice to anyone who can identify the picture and the bird" on his blog. Myself, I can't even see the bird.
