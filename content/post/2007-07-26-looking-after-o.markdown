Honestly. 




I lived in Oxford for a couple of years at the end of the '80s and when I left it was in good shape. Now my sister moves there and within a month it's a [complete](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/629/629/6911778.stm#oxon) [mess](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/gallery/2007/jul/25/internationalnews?picture=330267776). [Water everywhere](http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=oxford%20floods&w=all).
