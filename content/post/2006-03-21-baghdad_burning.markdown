Saturday saw another [post](http://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/2006_03_01_riverbendblog_archive.html#114264288537634165) on what is surely [the best of all weblogs](http://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/). There's so much stuff written about Iraq every day, it consistently amazes me that Riverbend's material gives both a perspective and basic information that I don't see anywhere else. Plus, she writes ridiculously well. Whoever she is, she's a hero.
