Best sentences of the day:

<blockquote>The juvenile sea squirt wanders through the sea searching for a suitable rock or hunk of coral to cling to and make its home for life. For this task, it has a rudimentary nervous system. When it finds its spot and takes root, it doesn't need its brain anymore, so it eats it! (It's rather like getting tenure.)
> 
> </blockquote>

Daniel C. Dennett, _Consciousness Explained_, p. 177.
