*** Configuration

The site is set up with:
- [[https://pages.github.com/][GitHub Pages]], to host the published static content and serve it.
- [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]], to generate the published static content from source.
- The [[https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/][Academic theme]], even though I'm not an academic, to style the web site presentation.
- [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]], with [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]], to write the material. Although some files, including this, are written directly in markdown using [[https://www.vim.org/][vim]] or [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][Microsoft VS Code]].
- I'm currently working on the content in an Ubuntu [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/][WSL2]] instance on Windows, and using [[https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/][MobaXTerm]] and/or [[https://github.com/microsoft/terminal][Windows Terminal]] to get at it. I try to confirm that it all works from windows too

*** How to

- Install hugo (extended version), which may need you to install golang.
- Clone the Academic theme
