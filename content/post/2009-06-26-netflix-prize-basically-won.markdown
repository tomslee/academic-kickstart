The Netflix Prize has a winning entry. There are i's to dot and t's to
cross, but there is now an entry that has achieved the 10% improvement
over Netflix's existing system that the prize demanded.

Judging
from the team name, the winning entry is a joint effort between three
leading teams: BellKor, Pragmatic Theory, and BigChaos.

  


Congratulations to
the winners!
