RSS is better than Twitter for keeping up with online reading. But that doesn't really matter, because Twitter has won. So I'm starting to share my posts via Twitter ([@whimsle](http://twitter.com/#!/whimsley)y) and will increasingly be following your blog on Twitter or not at all.




I will continue to resist sharing anything on Facebook except snarky comments aimed solely at my friends.
