The site is set up with:
- [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), to host the published static content and serve it.
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), to generate the published static content from source.
- The [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/), even though I'm not an academic, to style the web site presentation.
- [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) with [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/), to write the material. Although some files, including this, are written directly in markdown using [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) or [Microsoft VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- I'm currently working on the content in an Ubuntu [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) instance on Windows, and using [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) and/or [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) to get at it.
