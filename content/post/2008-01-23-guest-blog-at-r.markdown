Despite not being an economist, I'm a member of the [Progressive Economics Forum](http://www.progressive-economics.ca/). Today I have a [post](http://www.progressive-economics.ca/2008/01/23/beyond-defending-the-state/) up at their [Relentlessly Progressive Economics](http://www.progressive-economics.ca/relentless/) blog (RPE), courtesy of Marc Lee, entitled "Beyond Defending the State".




RPE has a lot of good material despite its inclusion of my post, with regular contributors including economists at the [Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives](http://www.policyalternatives.ca/), the [CAW/TCA](http://www.caw.ca/), and the CLC among others.
