Procrastinating at YouTube I type in sentimental search terms in hope of dredging up long lost gems.




And I am not disappointed. The magnificent John Cooper Clarke is there - about 50 separate videos,some original, others homages to the man. 




For those who have not had the pleasure, here are a few nasal rhymes from a true original:




Health Fanatic










Beasley Street










I mustn't go down to the sea again
