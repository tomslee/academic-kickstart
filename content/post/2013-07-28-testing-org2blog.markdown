I've been using the wonderful [org mode](http://orgmode.org/) more and more over the last year, but only now that [org2blog](https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog) has support for the new org-mode exporter am I trying it to blog with. 

 

Many thanks to Puneeth Chaganti for org2blog, and the remarkable [collection of developers](http://orgmode.org/org.html#History-and-Acknowledgments) who have turned org-mode into a swiss army knife of text tools without it becoming hideously deformed in the process.
