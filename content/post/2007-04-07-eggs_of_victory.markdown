Wisdom of Crowds? Hah! The problem was just not having someone expert enough.




Total number of Laura Secord chocolate eggs in the jar at their Kitchener store: **948**  
Total number guessed by yours truly: **947**




Victory is mine, along with the eggs and a two-foot-high chocolate rabbit. 




Eat your heart out, James Surowiecki.
