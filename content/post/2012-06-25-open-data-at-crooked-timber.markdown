Prompted by the flurry of activity around here, Henry Farrell of the highly-regarded Crooked Timber blog has organized a seminar on Open Data. In Timber-speak a seminar is a series of posts over the course of a week or so by a variety of guest bloggers, together with comments from the CT crowd, who are a very smart crowd indeed. So I'm thrilled at [the seminar](http://crookedtimber.org/2012/06/25/open-data-seminar/), and even more thrilled to be the first contributor; my contribution is [Seeing Like a Geek](http://crookedtimber.org/2012/06/25/seeing-like-a-geek/).
