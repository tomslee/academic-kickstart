I know, I'm all sceptical about this web stuff. But Unionbook looks like an interesting initiative. Developed using [Ning](http://www.ning.com) (a commercial platform) it provides a useful set of social networking tools for union members. You can find it at [http://www.unionbook.org](http://www.unionbook.org).
