Dear Editor,  
  
On today's front page we learn about the sad killing of a Canadian soldier in Afghanistan, with a poignant photograph and personal stories.   
  
On page A13 a single small paragraph in the "In Brief" section tells us that NATO forces killed two Afghan civilians. There are no names, no pictures. Not even the age or gender of the victims.
