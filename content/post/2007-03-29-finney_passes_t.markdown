For the first time in my lifetime (just) a PNE player has scored for England. I know it was Andorra, but still.




Now for the premiership.

<blockquote>Sir Tom Finney has spoken of his pride at seeing David Nugent become the first Preston North End player to score for England in 49 years.

> 
> "It was only a tap in but nevertheless he scored and that was very important on his debut," Finney told BBC Sport.
> 
> 

> 
> "It gives me a bit of a thrill to see a Preston player wearing an England shirt - the club itself will be very proud."

> Finney was the last Preston player to score for England when he found the net against Northern Ireland in 1958.
