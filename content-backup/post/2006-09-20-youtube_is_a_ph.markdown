Regular readers may remember that I posted on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zE-p2JE-Oc8) a little video of some caterpillars in my front yard a few months ago. I went back there a few days ago and took a look at how many times it had been viewed.




OVER 160,000.




This is obviously a much bigger audience than I will get for anything else I do in my entire life. I'm sure there is a moral in here somewhere, but I have no idea what it is.
