				Henry Farrell asked me what's going on with these no-prorogue rallies, and has posted my summary of events for the mainly anglo-australian-american audience at [Crooked Timber](http://crookedtimber.org/2010/01/27/tom-slee-on-the-proroguing-of-parliament/). Maybe some Canadian readers (that's you, Ruth and  RAD) can help answer some of the questions there.
