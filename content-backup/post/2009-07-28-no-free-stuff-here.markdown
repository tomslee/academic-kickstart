A few people have asked me whether I'm going to repeat my [Critical Reader's Guide to _The Long Tail_](http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/2007/03/the_long_tail_l.html) with Chris Anderson's new book _Free_. It's nice to be asked, so thank you. And I am, of course, susceptible to bribes and flattery. But the answer right now is No. Three reasons:  


  * I don't have a vendetta against the guy, so there's no particular reason to go after him again.
  * To be honest, I doubt that it will be interesting enough to spend that amount of time on.
  * I don't think the ideas will be as destructive as I think the Long Tail has been.
