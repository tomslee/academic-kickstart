Tom McCarthy being interviewed by Eleanor Wachtel on _Writers and Company_ about his new novel _[C](http://www.complete-review.com/reviews/gbx/mccarthy3.htm)_ :




<blockquote>

> When I did my research into emergent radio I was astonished to find, almost word for word, anticipations of the type of debates that were going on around the Internet from the '90s to now. You get wireless activists going "we don't want to be regulated, we don't want a central broadacster, it should remain many-to-many".

Surprising to me. Anyway, I'm off to buy [Remainder](http://openlibrary.org/authors/OL803231A/Tom_McCarthy) or C, both of which sound entertaining.
