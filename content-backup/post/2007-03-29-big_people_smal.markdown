These two just demand to be seen together.




[Little People - A Tiny Street Art Project](http://little-people.blogspot.com/) has many pictures of "little handpainted people left in London to fend for themselves". Very idiosyncratic, and very enjoyable.

You may want to see it full screen, which you can do [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBXr15K2uSc).
