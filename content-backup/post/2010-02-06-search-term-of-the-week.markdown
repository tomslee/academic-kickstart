First in a series of, well, probably one.

This week's most interesting search term entered to reach this blog goes to a Pennsylvania reader looking to find out: "[what the fuck is a unitary operator](http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=what+the+fuck+is+a+unitary+operator)" and ending [here](http://whimsley.typepad.com/whimsley/off_topic/). Sadly, he or she probably came away no better off than when they arrived.
