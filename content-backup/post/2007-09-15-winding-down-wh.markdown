Blogging has been non-existent for the last few weeks. I also have several emails from blog contacts that I have failed to reply to -- sorry Henry, Aaron and others. I've been diverted by non-digital politics (Ontario Elections), home life, and trying to do my day job.




I started the blog, as the top of the page says, mainly in an attempt to promote _No One Makes You Shop at Wal-Mart_. Well that came out 16 months ago, so anything I could do along those lines is done.




I have a few more pieces I want to post here, and then I'll take an indefinite blogbreak and try to do some longer-form writing.




After all, in the words of the Talking Heads; "Say something once, why say it again?"
