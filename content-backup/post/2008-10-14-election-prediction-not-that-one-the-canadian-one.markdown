We won't know who the PM is until mid-day tomorrow. Will it be minority Tory or Liberal-led coalition? Talks continue through the day until ... they fall apart. And it's back to the status quo. Oh, and the Greens take a single seat as May wins.
The nice thing about blog predictions is you can always edit your posts to fit reality.
