<blockquote>Another little tidbit gleaned from April's _Food & Wine_:
those sticker numbers on your fruit actually mean something. Here in

<blockquote><blockquote>"[T]he sticker labels on fruit: The numbers tell you how
the fruit was grown. Conventionally grown fruit has four digits;
organically grown fruit has five and starts with a nine; genetically
engineered has five numbers and starts with an eight."

<blockquote>Yesterday I checked out the organic apples at the market, and yes,
the numbers did indeed have five digits and started with a nine.
